Description: 
            A python 3 computer vision library that complements OpenCV 3.x to add many useful features for developers
            and researchers alike. Pyvision provides utilities that help in these core areas: training data preparation,
            displaying results, and applying vision algorithms to video streams.
        
            Training data preparation:
        
            * Apply affine transformations
            * Label points and polygons in images
            * Generate defined or random crops in images
            * Select good vs. bad tiles in a montage display
        
            Displaying results:
        
            * Easy and powerful image annotations of shapes, lines, text, and overlay masks
            * Compatible with shapely -- annotate shapely polygons to images
            * Annotations are kept on a separate layer from the underlying image
            * Display the image and save images with or without annotations
            * Show results in an "image montage" -- multiple images or tiles shown in a grid
            * Use image montage to select results (or to provide manual QA on the results)
            * Play back sequences of images like a video, with pause-and-play interface
        
            Video processing:
        
            * Pyvision Video class makes it easy to view and process common video files (avi, mpg, etc.), directories of images,
              or live streams from USB or IP cameras.
            * Video objects are iterators. ```for frame in vid: ...```
            * Create videos of your results, save a sequence of results as an avi file, for example. Simple and pythonic!
            * Apply background subtraction and motion detection to your video streams. Several common algorithms included
              or invent your own.
            * Video interface provides ability to buffer the video, to pause playback, to step through frame-by-frame,
              to resume playing with a certain per-frame delay, etc.
            * Video montage allows you to display multiple videos side-by-side in lockstep! And save the result
              as another video!
            * Register a call-back with a video object to allow you to process each frame with your own encapsulated code.
            * Create an image buffer from images or video
            * Treat image buffer as a 3D array of grayscale images, or display as a montage
        
            Pyvision3 is intended to be a successor to Pyvision that takes advantage of OpenCV 3.x and Python 3.x features.
            Huge thanks to David Bolme for being the originator of Pyvision. Many of the ease-of-use and interface ideas from
            the original Pyvision are carried forward, albeit with new implementations for Pyvision3.
