Description: #Slowprint
        
        This is simple module that objective is displays a animated text on the terminal.
        
        The module has only one function called `slowprint ()` that imposes a fixed time interval between the display of each character.
        The display can be vertically or horizontally.  
        The text can also be displayed in the *yoyo* mode where after the last character is displayed the text is removed regressively by means of a fixed interval of time between the deletion of each character.
        
        ##Use:
        
              slowprint ("Hello World my friend.", delay = 0.05, yoyo = True, vertical = True)    
              slowprint ("Hello World my friend.", delay = 0.05, yoyo = True, vertical = False)   
              slowprint ("Hello World my friend.", delay = 0.05, yoyo = False, vertical = True)   
              slowprint ("Hello World my friend.", delay = 0.05, yoyo = False, vertical = False)   
        
        ##Parameters:
        `text`    
        The text to be displayed on the terminal.   
        `delay`  
        The time in seconds between the display of each character. Default is 0.2 seconds.  
        `yoyo`   
        If True after displaying the last character, it begins to remove character by character regressively. Default is False.  
        `vertical`  
        If True displays the text vertically, if False displays the text horizontally. Default is False.
