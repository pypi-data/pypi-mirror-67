# pollevbot

**pollevbot** is a bot that automatically responds to polls on [pollev.com](https://pollev.com/). 
It continually checks if a specified host has opened any polls. Once a poll has been opened, 
it submits a random response. 

Requires Python 3.7 or later.
## Dependencies

[Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/), 
[BeautifulSoup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/). 

[APScheduler](https://pypi.org/project/APScheduler/) to deploy to Heroku.

## Usage

Install `pollevbot`:
```
pip install pollevbot
```

Set your username, password, and desired poll host:
```python
user = 'My Username'
password = 'My Password'
host = 'PollEverywhere URL Extension e.g. "uwpsych"'
```

And run the script.
```python
from pollevbot import PollBot

user = 'My Username'
password = 'My Password'
host = 'PollEverywhere URL Extension e.g. "uwpsych"'

# If you're using a non-UW PollEv account,
# add the argument "login_type='pollev'"
with PollBot(user, password, host) as bot:
    bot.run()
```
Alternatively, you can clone this repo, set your login credentials in 
[main.py](pollevbot/main.py) and run it from there.

## Heroku

**pollevbot** can be configured to run at scheduled dates/times with [Heroku](http://heroku.com/):

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/danielqiang/pollevbot)

#### Example ####

Suppose you want to answer polls made by poll host `teacher123` every Monday and Wednesday 
from 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM in your timezone on your UW account. To do this, first deploy to Heroku:


Set the config variables as follows:

* `DAY_OF_WEEK=mon,wed`
* `HOUR=11`
* `LIFETIME=3600`
* `LOGIN_TYPE=uw`
* `MINUTE=30`
* `PASSWORD=yourpassword`
* `POLLHOST=teacher123`
* `USERNAME=yourusername`

**Notes**: 

* The variables (`DAY_OF_WEEK`, `HOUR`, `MINUTE`) are 
[cron](https://apscheduler.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modules/triggers/cron.html) strings.
* Your timezone is automatically detected.

Then click `Deploy App` and wait for the app to finish building. 
**pollevbot** is now deployed to the Heroku!
