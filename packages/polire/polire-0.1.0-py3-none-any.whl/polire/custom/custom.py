    """
    Class to interpolate by fitting a sklearn type Regressor to
    the given data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    regressor: class definition,
        This variable is used to pass in the Regressor we would like
        to use for interpolation. The regressor sould be sklearn type
        regressor. Example from sklearn.ensemble -> RandomForestRegressor
    
    reg_kwargs: dict, optional
        This is a dictionary that is passed into the Regressor initialization.
        Use this to change the behaviour of the passed regressor. Default = empty dict

    Attributes
    ----------
    reg : object
        Object of the `regressor` class passed.
