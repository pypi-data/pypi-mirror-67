A `Django`_ application to add `django-crispy-forms`_ template pack and layout objects
for the `GOV.UK Design System`_.

*******
Install
*******
This assumes you have already installed django-crispy-forms in your
project. If not, the `install guide`_ is very simple.

1. Install the package from PyPI: ::

    pip install crispy-forms-gds

2. Add the app to your settings: ::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'crispy_forms_gds',
        ...
    )

3. Override the crispy_forms settings to set the template pack as the default: ::

    CRISPY_ALLOWED_TEMPLATE_PACKS = (
        "bootstrap", "bootstrap3", "bootstrap4", "uni_form", "gds"
    )
    CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK = "gds"

NOTE: The app does not include any GDS assets, you will have to install them
in your project. Details are provided on the `GOV.UK Design System`_ site.
Follow the `Getting started`_ guide and the installation instructions for a
`production`_ install. The demo site has a `webpack config`_ file which you
might find useful.

*******
Example
*******
To use the template pack just build a regular crispy form as before but the
layout objects are imported from crispy_forms_gds: ::

    from django import forms
    from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _

    from crispy_forms_gds.helper import FormHelper
    from crispy_forms_gds.layout import Submit


    class TextInputForm(forms.Form):

        name = forms.CharField(
            label=_("Name"),
            widget=forms.TextInput(),
            help_text=_("Your full name."),
            error_messages={
                "required": _("Enter your name as it appears on your passport")
            }
        )

        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
            self.helper = FormHelper()
            self.helper.add_input(Submit("submit", _("Submit")))

And render the form in your templates: ::

    {% load i18n crispy_forms_tags %}
    ...
    {% crispy form %}
    ...

That's it.

**********
All in one
**********
The template pack supports all the basic components listed in the `GOV.UK Design System`_:

Demo
****
If you checkout the code from the repository, there is a Django site you can run
to see the forms in action. You will need to `install nvm`_ for managing node
versions first. After that build everything and run the demo with: ::

    make serve
