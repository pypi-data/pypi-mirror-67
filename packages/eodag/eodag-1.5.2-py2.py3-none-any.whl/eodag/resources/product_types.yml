S1_SAR_OCN:
  abstract: |
    Level-2 OCN products include components for Ocean Swell spectra (OSW) providing continuity with ERS and ASAR WV
    and two new components: Ocean Wind Fields (OWI) and Surface Radial Velocities (RVL).
    The OSW is a two-dimensional ocean surface swell spectrum and includes an estimate of the wind speed and direction
    per swell spectrum. The OSW is generated from Stripmap and Wave modes only. For Stripmap mode, there are multiple
    spectra derived from internally generated Level-1 SLC images. For Wave mode, there is one spectrum per vignette.
    The OWI is a ground range gridded estimate of the surface wind speed and direction at 10 m above the surface
    derived from internally generated Level-1 GRD images of SM, IW or EW modes.
    The RVL is a ground range gridded difference between the measured Level-2 Doppler grid and the Level-1 calculated
    geometrical Doppler.

S1_SAR_GRD:
  abstract: |
    Level-1 Ground Range Detected (GRD) products consist of focused SAR data that has been detected, multi-looked and
    projected to ground range using an Earth ellipsoid model. Phase information is lost. The resulting product has
    approximately square spatial resolution pixels and square pixel spacing with reduced speckle at the cost of worse
    spatial resolution.
    GRD products can be in one of three resolutions:
      Full Resolution (FR),
      High Resolution (HR),
      Medium Resolution (MR).
    The resolution is dependent upon the amount of multi-looking performed. Level-1 GRD products are available in MR
    and HR for IW and EW modes, MR for WV mode and MR, HR and FR for SM mode.

    each dimension using the full transmit signal bandwidth and consist of complex samples preserving the phase
    information.

    coordinates refer to the upper left corner of the pixel. Level-1C products will additionally include Cloud Masks
    and ECMWF data (total column of ozone, total column of water vapour and mean sea level pressure).
