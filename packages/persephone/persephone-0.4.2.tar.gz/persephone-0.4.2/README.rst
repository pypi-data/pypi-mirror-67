Persephone v0.4.2 (beta version)
================================

Persephone (/pərˈsɛfəni/) is an automatic phoneme transcription tool.
Traditional speech recognition tools require a large pronunciation
lexicon (describing how words are pronounced) and much training data so
that the system can learn to output orthographic transcriptions. In
contrast, Persephone is designed for situations where training data is
limited, perhaps as little as an hour of transcribed speech. Such
limitations on data are common in the documentation of low-resource
languages. It is possible to use such small amounts of data to train a
transcription model that can help aid transcription, yet such technology
has not been widely adopted.

    The speech recognition tool presented here is named after the
    goddess who was abducted by Hades and must spend one half of each
    year in the Underworld. Which of linguistics or computer science is
    Hell, and which the joyful world of spring and light? For each it’s
    the other, of course. --- Alexis Michaud

The goal of Persephone is to make state-of-the-art phonemic
transcription accessible to people involved in language documentation.
Creating an easy-to-use user interface is central to this. The user
interface and APIs are a work in progress and currently Persephone must
be run via a command line.

The tool is implemented in Python/Tensorflow with extensibility in mind.
Currently just one model is implemented, which uses bidirectional long
short-term memory (LSTMs) and the connectionist temporal classification
(CTC) loss function.
