Fixtures available to the tests/.

- In general, fixtures should return a single instance.

- If a fixture is a factory, its name should reflect that.

- A fixture that is parametrized should be suffixed with
  ``_parametrized`` to imply it has increased complexity.

    # 18:00 time, '2015-12-12 18:00', is not mocked in the first two tests,
    # but then it is in the third test!! So confused!
