    #              Only print if no facts whatsoever,
    #                as opposed to no facts matching query?
    #        I'd say either print message on stderr and exit, or
    #        print empty table on stdout, so that a tool in the
    #        pipeline would only see empty string or empty table
    #        on stdin, and never a message, so that post-processing
    #        won't die on unexpected error message string.
    msg = _('No {} were found for the specified query.').format(item_type)
    # (lb): I sorta like the message, not table, on no results,
    # because you can tell quicker that nothing was found. I.e.,
    # when I see an empty tell, I spend a nanosecond scanning it
    # for rows, because when I see table headers, I expect to see
    # table rows! So I'm kinda liking printing a message, not table.
