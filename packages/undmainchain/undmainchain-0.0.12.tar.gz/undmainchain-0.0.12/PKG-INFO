Description: Unification Mainnet Helpers
        ===========================
        
        Miscellaneous tools to help support the maintenance of Unification
        Mainnet EVs can be found here.
        
        Defaults
        --------
        
        Due to the complexity of the beast, these tools will only work with our
        standard environments. This library also only currently supports Linux.
        There is some room for differences that the codebase can be modified to
        handle.
        
        To view what the expected defaults are:
        
            python -m undmainchain.cli.defaults show
        
        All the helpers take a `--machine` option that loads custom values.
        These values are defined in the `undmainchain.const` module.
        
        Reset All
        ---------
        
        This command will wipe all your chain data, use the latest published und
        versions and genesis. Whilst it may take much time to catch up, this is
        a good fresh slate if needed.
        
            python -m undmainchain.cli.upgrade revert
        
        ### Install a specific version
        
            python -m undmainchain.cli.upgrade binaries 1.4.1
        
        Export to S3
        ------------
        
        ### Genesis Export
        
        The export helper will stop the EV, export the chain data to a JSON file
        and upload it to Amazon S3, and start the EV again.
        
            python -m undmainchain.cli.export genesis <HEIGHT> <AWSKEY> <AWSSECRET>
        
        ### Chain Export
        
        The entire chain can be compressed and exported to S3. Warning: chains
        can be large and uploading to S3 can incur cost.
        
            python -m undmainchain.cli.export chain <AWSKEY> <AWSSECRET>
        
        Network upgrades
        ----------------
        
        There is also a helper that support network upgrades
        
            python -m undmainchain.cli.upgrade genesis 700000
        
        The helper will wait until the specified block and then perform an
        upgrade.
