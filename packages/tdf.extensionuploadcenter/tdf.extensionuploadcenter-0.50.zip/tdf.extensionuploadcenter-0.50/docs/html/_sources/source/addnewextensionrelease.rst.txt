Add A New Release To An Extension Project
#########################################

An owner of an extension project could add a release to the own project.
There is a link at the top of an extension project page whilst the owner
is logged-in to the Plone site. Once he clicked on this link he got an edit
form to enter the content of the new release.

The owner could make alternatively a mouse click on the menu entry
'Add new' in the menu bar on the left side and choose from the opening
sub menu the entry 'Extension Release' (see the small red arrow in the
screenshot above).

The form dialog consists of several register. The form fields in the first
register asks for more general information about the release. It's possible
to edit and change the content of the fields later, if there is something
missing or there are e.g. typos, that should be fixed.

The First Register 'Default'
****************************

The new extension release needs its own release number. This number (up to
twelf chars) will be part of the release title and its URL. The title will
be created from the extension project title and the release number. This
title has to be unique inside the Plone site. If the release number is
already in use, the editor will get an error message about it.

A new release needs also a summary and could get a full release description
with details about its features. The latter one is optional (only form
fields with a red point behind the title are mandatory).

There is also an optional field to add changelog information, especially if
the extension release adds some new features or fix some issues.

The field for the email address will be initialized with the email address
from the extension project the release was added to.

The Second Register 'Compatibility'
***********************************

This register contains a form field to choose the versions of the program the
release is compatible with. The list of program versions will be created by
the site admin within the 'Extension Center'. It is possible to choose
multiple program versions for the release compatibility.

The third register shows the necessary fields for the legal statements about
the release. It starts with the license for the release. It is possible to
check more than one license for a release. This declaration need to be in

There is also a read-only form field which contains the text of the legal
disclaimer that has to be accepted by the extension release owner. The text of
the legal disclaimer will be set by the site admin inside the 'Extension
Center'.

If the source code is not inside the extension file (the drop down field
is set to 'No'), it is necessary to fill in the link to the source code in
the form field at the bottom of the register. If such a link will not be
submitted the release owner gets an error message.

This register is the place to upload the extension release file and declare
