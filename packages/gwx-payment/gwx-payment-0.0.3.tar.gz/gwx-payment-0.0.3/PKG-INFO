        - PyYAML
        - stripe
        - Werkzeug 0.16^
        
        ### Installation
        1. Install the package using pip, by executing:
        ```python
        pip install -U gwx-payment
        ```
        
        2. Create the `<your_config_name>.yaml` file, this MUST follow the following convention:
        
        ```yaml
        
        
         
        # This indicates the current `Active` payment service 
        provider: stripe
        
        
        stripe:
          api_url: <api_url>
          public_key: <public_key>
          api_key: <api_key>
          success_url: <success_url>
          cancel_url: <cancel_url>
        
        paypal:
          api_url: <api_url>
          public_key: <public_key>
          api_key: <api_key>
          success_url: <success_url>
          cancel_url: <cancel_url>
        ```
        
        
        ### Quickstart
        First import the Provider Service class
        
        ```python
        from gwx_payment.provider_service import ProviderService
        ``` 
        
        Then instantiate the ProviderService class along with it's config dependencies:
        
        ```python
        payment_variable = ProviderService('/path/to/config/dir', 'your_config_name.yaml').get_payment_service()
        ```
        
        The provider service accepts a `.yaml` file type as it's config file.
        Viola! you can now use it for your payment transactions.
