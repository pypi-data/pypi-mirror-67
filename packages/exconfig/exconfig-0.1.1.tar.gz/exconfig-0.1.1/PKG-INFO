        About
        -----
        
        *exconfig* is a Python library for working with input parameter files. It
        provides parameter description and validation, as well as ways of working
        with various file formats.
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        *exonfig* requires Python 3.
        
        Apart from Python, *exconfig* has a number of other requirements, all of which
        can be obtained through either *pip* or *conda*, that will be automatically
        installed when you install *exconfig*.
        
        To see a full listing of the requirements, have a look at the project's
        *requirements.txt* file.
        
        If you are a developer of *exconfig* you will also want to install
        additional dependencies for running *exconfig*'s tests to make sure
        that things are working as they should. These dependencies are listed
        in *requirements-testing.txt*.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Stable Release
        ++++++++++++++
        
        *exconfig*, and its dependencies, can be installed either with *pip*
        or *conda*. Using *pip*::
        
            $ pip install exconfig
        
        Using *conda*::
        
            $ conda install exconfig -c conda-forge
        
        From Source
        +++++++++++
        
        After downloading the *exconfig* source code, run the following from
        *exconfig*'s top-level folder (the one that contains *setup.py*) to
        install *exconfig* into the current environment::
        
          $ pip install -e .
