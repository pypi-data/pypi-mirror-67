# gmsaas

## Description

`gmsaas` is a command line interface for Genymotion Cloud SaaS.

## Requirements

- Python 3.5 or above
- pip3
- Android SDK

## Installation

```bash
pip3 install gmsaas
```

## Configuration

### Prerequisites

Two steps are required to use `gmsaas` properly:

- Configure the path to your Android SDK with:

  ```bash
  gmsaas config set android-sdk-path <sdk_path>
  ```

- Authenticate with:

  ```bash
  gmsaas auth login <email>
  ```

### Proxy

If you are behind a corporate proxy, `gmsaas` may not be able to access the Internet with its default settings.

HTTP/HTTPS proxy settings can be configured via `gmsaas config` command.

```
gmsaas config set proxy http[s]://host:port
```

For an authenticated proxy, credentials can be passed in the URL:

```
gmsaas config set proxy http[s]://user:password@host:port
```

Alternatively, to avoid having the proxy credentials stored in `gmsaas` configuration file, you can set the credentials using environment variables:

```
GMSAAS_PROXY_USERNAME: the username used to connect to the proxy
GMSAAS_PROXY_PASSWORD: the password of given user
```

Note: Only HTTP/HTTPS proxies are supported.

## Features

### List recipes

`gmsaas recipes list`

Lists recipes that can be started with `gmsaas instances start`.

> A recipe is a template with a given Android version, display size, density and specifications (CPU, memory, storage) which generally match those of a real device. Recipe UUID is the identifier used when starting an instance.

### Start an instance

`gmsaas instances start <recipe_uuid> <name> [--no-wait]`

Creates and starts an instance `<name>` based on the specified `<recipe_uuid>` recipe. The command returns once the instance is started, unless the `--no-wait` option has been set. In both cases the instance UUID is printed on standard output.

### Connect an instance to ADB

`gmsaas instances adbconnect <instance_uuid> [--adb-serial-port PORT]`

Connects the instance `<instance_uuid>` to ADB. The command returns once ADB is connected. If the `--adb-serial-port <PORT>` option is set, the instance will be connected to ADB on `localhost:<PORT>`.

### List running instances

`gmsaas instances list [--quiet/-q]`

Lists running instances. This also provides the ADB serial used if the instance is connected to ADB. If `--quiet` is set, only instance UUIDs will be displayed.

### Stop an instance

`gmsaas instances stop <instance_uuid> [--no-wait]`

Stops the specified instance. The command returns once the instance is fully stopped, unless the `--no-wait` option has been set.

## Bash/Zsh auto-completion

`gmsaas` supports Bash and Zsh auto-completion. To activate it, you need to inform your shell that completion is available.

For Bash, add this to your `.bashrc`:

```bash
eval "$(_GMSAAS_COMPLETE=source gmsaas)"
```

For Zsh, add this to your `.zshrc`:

```bash
eval "$(_GMSAAS_COMPLETE=source_zsh gmsaas)"
```

Note: you must type at least one dash to complete command-line options.

## Issues

Whatever your problem is, the Support Team will need logs to speed up the investigations.
To generate them:

1. Reproduce your issue
2. Run `gmsaas logzip`: an archive named `gmsaas-logs-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.zip` will be created in the current directory
3. Contact us [here](https://www.genymotion.com/contact/), don't forget to attach the logs archive
