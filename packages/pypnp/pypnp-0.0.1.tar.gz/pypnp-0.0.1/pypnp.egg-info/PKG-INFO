        ## Usage
        
        In the project you want to use pypnp in, first install `pypnp`.
        
        ```shell
        python -m pip install pypnp
        ```
        
        A lock file will be generated the first time you run your application, if one does not exist. To run your python application:
        
        ```shell
        PYTHONPATH=. pypnp-run my.python.module.path
        ```

        This project is still in extremely early stages and not ready for external contributors just yet. Once the idea is flushed out a bit more, I'll open it up.
        
        To setup a virtual environment and install development dependencies:
        
        ```shell
        . script/bootstrap
        ```
