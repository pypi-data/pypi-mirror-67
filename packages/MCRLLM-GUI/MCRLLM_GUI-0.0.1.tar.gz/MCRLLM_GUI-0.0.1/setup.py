    \n\n# Method first presented in\
    \nLavoie F.B., Braidy N. and Gosselin R. (2016) Including Noise Characteristics in MCR to improve Mapping and Component Extraction from Spectral Images, Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems, 153, 40-50.\
    \n\n# Input data\
    \nAlgorithm is designed to treat 2D data X(nxk) where n spectra acquired over k energy levels.\
    \nA 3D spectral image X(n1,n2,k) can be reshaped to a 2D matrix X(n1xn2,k) prior to MCRLLM analysis. Composition maps can then be obtained by reshaping C(n1xn2,a) into 2D chemical maps C(n1,n2,a).\
    \n# Examples\
    \nTwo full examples, along with datasets, are provided in 'Download Files'.\
    \nPlease refer to 'MCRLLM_example.pdf' for full details.\
    \n  - Example 1: 1D spectral linescan of EELS data.\
    \n  - Example 2: 2D spectral image of XPS data.\
