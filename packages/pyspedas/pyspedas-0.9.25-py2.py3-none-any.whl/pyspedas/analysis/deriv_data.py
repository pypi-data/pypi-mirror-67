File:
    deriv_data.py

Description:
    Creates a tplot variable that is the derivative of a tplot variable.

Parameters:
    names: str/list of str
        List of pytplot names.
    new_names: str/list of str
        List of new_names for pytplot variables.
        If not given, then a suffix is applied.
    suffix: str
        A suffix to apply. Default is '-avg'.
    overwrite: bool
        Replace the existing tplot name.

Notes:
    Similar to deriv_data.pro in IDL SPEDAS.
