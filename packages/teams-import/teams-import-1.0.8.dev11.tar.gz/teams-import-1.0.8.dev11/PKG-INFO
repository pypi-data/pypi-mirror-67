Description: # teams-import
        A PowerShell tool to bulk import students to Microsoft Teams.
        
        ## Requirements
        * MacOS with Powershell installed: [Install Powershell on MacOS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-macos?view=powershell-7)
        * A Deakin University email address which is a member of the Microsoft Team(s) you are looking to import students to.
        * A directory, containing CSV file(s). The files must have the unit ID as the name of the file. For example: 
        
        ```
        /unit-csvs/sit102.csv
        /unit-csvs/sit111.csv
        ```
        
        ### CSV Format
        * A single column CSV with the title "email", followed by the list of student deakin emails which will be imported.
        
        ## Usage
        
        1. Run the tool:
        
        `teams-import [OPTIONS] CSV_DIR EMAIL`
        
        example:
        
        `teams-import ./unit-csvs jake.renzella@deakin.edu.au`
        
        2. Follow the command line instructions and authenticate the teams Powershell environment. You will see a line like the following:
        
        > WARNING: To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://microsoft.com/devicelogin and enter the code GUXEKTDPP to authenticate.`
        
        Open the link, log in, and authenticate with the code.
        
        3. Once authenticated, the command line will try and import the students. Note: for large units, the import may take several minutes.
