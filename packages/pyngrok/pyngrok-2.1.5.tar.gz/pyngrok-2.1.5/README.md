`pyngrok` is a Python wrapper for [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) that manages its own binary and puts
it on our path, making `ngrok` readily available from anywhere on the command line and via a
convenient Python API.

## Installation

`pyngrok` is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyngrok/) and can be installed
using `pip`.

```sh
pip install pyngrok
```

That's it! `pyngrok` is now available as a package to our Python projects, and `ngrok` is now available from
the command line.

## Basic Usage

To open a tunnel, use the `connect()` method, which returns the public URL generated by `ngrok`.

```python
from pyngrok import ngrok

# Open a HTTP tunnel on the default port 80
public_url = ngrok.connect()
# Open a SSH tunnel
ssh_url = ngrok.connect(22, "tcp")
```

The `connect()` method takes an optional `options` parameter, which allows us to pass additional
options that are [supported by ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs#tunnel-definitions).

This package also puts the default `ngrok` binary on our path, so all features of `ngrok` are
available on the command line.

```sh
ngrok http 80
```

For details on how to fully leverage `ngrok` from the command line, see [ngrok's official documentation](https://ngrok.com/docs).
