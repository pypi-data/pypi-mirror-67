Features
--------

Hydrodata is a python library designed to aid in watershed analysis. It provides access to hydrology and climatology databases with some helper functions for visualization. Currently, the following data retrieval services are supported:

* `NLDI <https://labs.waterdata.usgs.gov/about-nldi/>`_ and `NHDPlus V2 <https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/national-hydrography/national-hydrography-dataset?qt-science_support_page_related_con=0#qt-science_support_page_related_con>`_ for vector river network, catchments, and other NHDPlus data.
* `Daymet <https://daymet.ornl.gov/>`__ for climatology data, both single pixel and gridded
* `SSEBop <https://earlywarning.usgs.gov/ssebop/modis/daily>`_ for daily actual evapotranspiration, both single pixel and gridded
* `NLCD 2016 <https://www.mrlc.gov/>`__ for land cover, land use (some utilities are available for analysing and plotting the cover data)
* `NWIS <https://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis>`__ for daily streamflow observations
* `HCDN 2009 <https://www2.usgs.gov/science/cite-view.php?cite=2932>`_ for identifying sites where human activity affects the natural flow of the watercourse
* `3DEP <https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/3dep>`_ for Digital Elevation Model

Additionally, the following functionalities are offered:

* **Interactive map** for exploring USGS stations within a bounding box,
* Efficient vector-based **flow accumulation** in a stream network,
* Computing **Potential Evapotranspiration** (PET) using Daymet data based on `FAO-56 <http://www.fao.org/3/X0490E/X0490E00.htm>`_,
* High level APIs for easy access to all ArcGIS `RESTful <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer>`_-based services as well as `WMS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Service>`_- and `WFS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Feature_Service>`_-based services,
* Helpers for plotting land cover data based on **official NLCD cover legends**,
* A **roughness coefficients** lookup table for each land cover type which is useful for overland flow routing.

Requests for additional databases or functionalities can be submitted via `issue tracker <https://github.com/cheginit/hydrodata/issues>`_.

Documentation

Installation
------------

It's recommended to use `Conda <https://conda.io/en/latest/>`_ as the Python package management tool so the dependencies can be installed easily since Hydrodata is pure Python but its dependencies are not. This can be achieved using the ``environment.yml`` file provided in this repository. You can clone the repository or download the file from `here <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cheginit/hydrodata/master/environment.yml>`_.

.. code-block:: console

    $ conda env create -f environment.yml

The environment can then be activate by issuing ``conda activate hydrodata``.

Alternatively, you can install the `dependencies <https://hydrodata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_ manually, then install Hydrodata using ``pip``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install hydrodata

Quickstart
----------

With just a few lines of code, Hydrodata provides easy access to a handful of databases. ``Station`` gathers the USGS site information such as name, contributing drainage area, and watershed geometry.

.. code-block:: python

    from hydrodata import Station
    import hydrodata.datasets as hds

    wshed = Station(start='2000-01-01', end='2010-01-21', coords=(-69.32, 45.17))

The generated ``wshed`` object has a property that shows whether the station is in HCDN database i.e., it's a natural watershed or affected by human activity. For this watershed ``wshed.hcdn`` is ``True``, therefore, this is a natural watershed. Moreover, Using the retrieved information such as the watershed geometry we can then use the ``datasets`` module to access the databases. For example, we can get main river channel and tributaries, USGS stations upstream (or downstream) of the main river channel (or tributatires) up to a certain distance, say 150 km or all the stations:

.. code-block:: python

    tributaries = hds.NLDI.tributaries(wshed.station_id)
    main = hds.NLDI.main(wshed.station_id)
    stations = hds.NLDI.stations(wshed.station_id)
    stations_m150 = hds.NLDI.stations(wshed.station_id, navigation="upstreamMain", distance=150)

For demonstrating the flow accumulation function, lets assum the flow in each river segment is equal to the length of the river segment. Therefore, theoretically the accumulated flow at the outlet should be equall to the total length of the river network.

.. code-block:: python

    from hydrodata import utils

    flw = utils.prepare_nhdplus(hds.NLDI.flowlines('01031500'), 0, 0, purge_non_dendritic=False)
    segments = flw[["comid", "tocomid", "lengthkm"]].copy()

    def routing(qin, q):
        return qin.item() + q

    qsim = utils.vector_accumulation(segments, routing, ["lengthkm"], 1)["out"]

We can check using ``abs(qsim - segments.lengthkm.sum()) = 1e-13``. Furthermore, DEM can be retrieved for the station's contributing watershed at 30 arc-second (~1 km) resolution, as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    dem = hds.nationalmap_dem(wshed.geometry, resolution=30)

The climate data and streamflow observations for a location of interest can be retrieved as well:

.. code-block:: python

    variables = ["tmin", "tmax", "prcp"]
    clm_p = hds.daymet_byloc(wshed.lon, wshed.lat,
                             start=wshed.start, end=wshed.end,
                             variables=variables, pet=True)
    clm_p['Q (cms)'] = hds.nwis_streamflow(wshed.station_id, wshed.start, wshed.end)

Other than point-based data, we can get gridded databases that are masked with the watershed geometry. Note the use of ``pet`` flag for computing PET:

.. code-block:: python

    clm_g = hds.daymet_bygeom(wshed.geometry,
                              start='2005-01-01', end='2005-01-31',
                              variables=variables, pet=True)
    eta_g = hds.ssebopeta_bygeom(wshed.geometry, start='2005-01-01', end='2005-01-31')

All the gridded data are returned as `xarray <https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/>`_ datasets that has efficient data processing tools. Hydrodata also has a ``plot`` module that plots five hydrologic signatures graphs in one plot.

.. code-block:: python

    from hydrodata import plot

    plot.signatures(clm_loc['Q (cms)'], wshed.drainage_area, prcp=clm_loc['prcp (mm/day)'], title=wshed.name)

Some example plots are shown below:

        :target: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cheginit/hydrodata/develop/docs/_static/example_plots.png

The ``services`` module can be used to access some other web services as well. For example, we can accessing `Los Angeles GeoHub <http://geohub.lacity.org/>`_ RESTful service, NationalMap's `3D Eleveation Program <https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/3dep>`_ via WMS and `FEMA National Flood Hazard Layer <https://www.fema.gov/national-flood-hazard-layer-nfhl>`_ via WFS as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    from hydrodata import services
    from arcgis2geojson import arcgis2geojson
    import geopandas as gpd

    la_wshed = Station('2005-01-01', '2005-01-31', '11092450')

    url_rest = "https://maps.lacity.org/lahub/rest/services/Stormwater_Information/MapServer/10"
    s = services.ArcGISREST(url_rest, outFormat="json")
    s.get_featureids(la_wshed.geometry)
    storm_pipes = s.get_features()

    url_wms = "https://elevation.nationalmap.gov/arcgis/services/3DEPElevation/ImageServer/WMSServer"
    slope = services.wms_bygeom(
                      url_wms,
                      "3DEP",
                      geometry=la_wshed.geometry,
                      version="1.3.0",
                      layers={"slope": "3DEPElevation:Slope Degrees"},
                      outFormat="image/tiff",
                      resolution=1)

    url_wfs = "https://hazards.fema.gov/gis/nfhl/services/public/NFHL/MapServer/WFSServer"
    r = services.wfs_bybox(
                       url_wfs,
                       bbox=la_wshed.geometry.bounds,
                       version="2.0.0",
                       layer="public_NFHL:Base_Flood_Elevations",
                       outFormat="esrigeojson",
                       in_crs="epsg:4326",
                       out_crs="epsg:4269")
    flood = gpd.GeoDataFrame.from_features(arcgis2geojson(r.json()),
                                           crs="epsg:4269").to_crs("epsg:4326")


Contributing
------------

Hydrodata offers some limited statistical analysis. It could be more useful to the watershed modeling community to integrate more data exploratory capabilities to the package. Additionally, adding support for more databases such as water quality, phenology, and water level, are very welcome. If you are interested please get in touch. You can find information about contributing to hydrodata at our `Contributing page <https://hydrodata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html>`_.
