        Task executor - balance between Makefile and Gradle [see documentation_]

        NOTICE: This project is in testing stage. There is no stable release yet, but it will come very soon.
        
        **Goals:**
        
        - Define tasks as simple as in Makefile
        - Reuse code as simple as in Gradle (using extensions that provides tasks. Extensions are installable from PIP)
        - Simple configuration in Python
        - Write tasks code in Python as simple as possible
        
        Rules
        -----
        
        -  No hooks eg. task.executeAfter(otherTask), no complex dependencies
        -  No dynamic tasks names eg. by turning on Publish component it should
           not create tasks eg. :publishIWAToDockerRegistry (where IWA is the
           project name)
        -  Don't pack too many features into the core, do this in external modules. Keep the RKD core clean!
        -  Full static analysis, you can work on makefile.py and on task's code in PyCharm with full code completion!
        -  Do early validation. Runtime validation for long running builds is a pain-in-the-ass for the user.
