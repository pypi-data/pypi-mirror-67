# **URAEUS** | NMBD-Py

**Numerical Multi-Body Dynamics in Python** | A numerical simulation environment of constrained multi-body systems.

## Description

**uraeus.nmbd.python** is a numerical simulation environment developed in python, that generates numerical object-oriented code from symbolic models developed in **[uraeus.smbd]( https://github.com/khaledghobashy/uraeus-smbd )**, and provides various numerical solvers for multi-body systems.

*Please visit **[uraeus.smbd]( https://github.com/khaledghobashy/uraeus-smbd )** for more information about **audience** , **fields of applications** and **background**.*
