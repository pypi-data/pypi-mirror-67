# Description

This is a basic HTTP API based on the processes that Flask uses, but in a simple (and more limitating) way.
It's meant to be easy to use and short to the point

I described a lot the process in the source. Don't be shy to check it out if you want to understand it
There's also an example.py with some basics inside

# Functionnalities 

- Routes with variables
- Request handler
- Security handler (which can be modified with an abstract class already present)

# Basic example : 

    from http_api.server import HTTPServerAPI
    http = HTTPServerAPI()

    @http.url("/")
    def index():
        # Do something

    http.run()

# Security concerns
