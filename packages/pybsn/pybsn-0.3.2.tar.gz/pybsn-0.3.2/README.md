[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bigswitch/pybsn.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/bigswitch/pybsn)
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/pybsn.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pybsn/)

## Installation

```bash
pip install pybsn
# ... or ...
pip3 install pybsn
```
pybsn is compatible with python 2.7+ and python 3.

## PyBSN Repl - Interactive Shell

`pybsn-repl` is a powerful, interactive shell for the REST API. It is based on and requires python3 and ipython 7.0. (**Note**: The pybsn library works with python 2.7 and python 3, the repl program requires python 3!)

### Installing Python3 on Mac

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a recommended option to install python3 on mac

After you install homebrew, install python3 with

```
brew install python
```

### Installing IPython 7
```bash
pip3 install ipython
```
* Note: make sure you use the `pip` module associated with `python3`. Often, it is available as `pip3`; otherwise you may want to try `python3 -m pip install ...` instead.

### Running pybsn-repl
```bash
./bin/pybsn-repl -H <controller_host> -u <user> -p <passwd>
```
**Note:** `pybsn-repl` requires `pybsn` to be available; you can either install it from `pip` (see above); or use it directly from the source by prefixing the
command with `PYTHONPATH=<dir>`, e.g.,

```bash
~/dev/pybsn $ PYTHONPATH=. ./bin/pybsn-repl -H <controller_host> -u <user> -p <passwd>
```

### Using pybsn-repl

PyBSN-reply presents an IPython shell to interact with the REST API.

It accepts any python expressions, and exposes the following variables as primary
entry points:
* `ctrl`: BigDbClient instance
* `root`: ctrl.root - a reference to the root node.

#### Node Hierarchy

You can explore the DB Rest API anchored on `root`. Child nodes in the rest API are
dynamically exposed as child objects / properties of `root`. Hyphens (`-`) in the REST API
are converted to `_` for python.

E.g.,
* `root.core.switch` references the node `controller/core/switch`
* `root.core.switch_config` references the node `controller/core/switch-config`

Nodes that cannot be represented as properties because their name is a python keyword (e.g., `global`), can be accessed by dictionary style access, e.g.
```python
root.os.config["global"]
```

#### Operations on nodes:
* add a `#` at the end of the line to show the *Schema* at the given node.
```python
In [12]: root.core.switch_config#
controller/core/switch-config (list)
  # List of switches that are configured in the controller. Switch
  # configuration is keyed by a logical switch name and is bound to a
  # specific physical switch by its dpid
  banner : string (config)
    # The switch banner, which is displayed on login.
  description : string (config)
    # A description of this configured switch.
[...]
```

* invoke the node as a functon `<node>()` to perform a `GET` request against the node:
```python
In [8]: root.core.switch_config()
Out[8]:
[{'mac-address': '52:54:00:21:4c:56',
  'name': 'sn1',
  'role': 'service',
  'shutdown': False},
 {'mac-address': '52:54:00:c1:40:1e',
  'name': 'swl1',
  'role': 'bigtap',
  'shutdown': False}]
```
* call `match(<property>=<value>)` to add an exact-match predicate to the query:
```python
In [11]: root.core.switch_config.match(name='sn1')()
Out[11]:
[{'mac-address': '52:54:00:21:4c:56',
  'name': 'sn1',
  'role': 'service',
  'shutdown': False}]
```

* call HTTP methods on the node to mutate data:
   * `node.post(data)` - inserts data at the node
   * `node.put(data)` - replaces the node entirely with the new data
   * `node.patch(data)` - selectively updates the node with the given data, leaving unspecified values untouched
   * `node.delete()` - delete the node

In these examples, `data` is a JSON serializable object, often a dictionary. Node that the dictionary keys must be in schema format at present (i.e., with hyphens, `some-long-property` not `some_long_property`).

* call `node.rpc(input_data)` to make an RPC call to the RPC specified in the node.

`input_data` is a JSON serializable object, often a dictionary. Node that the dictionary keys must be in schema format at present (i.e., with hyphens, `some-long-property` not `some_long_property`).

The output/result of the RPC returned as a dictionary.


#### More Examples:

```python
# Show the schema for controller.core.switch
root.core.switch#

# Get info for all switches
root.core.switch()

# Get info for a specific switch
root.core.switch.match(name="leaf0a").get()
```

## Example Programmatic Usage

```python
from pybsn.bcf.api import Api
api = Api("127.0.0.1", "admin", "adminadmin")

switches = api.get_switches()
print switches
[<pybsn.bcf.switch.Switch object at 0x10f3c7390>, <pybsn.bcf.switch.Switch object at 0x10f3c7790>, <pybsn.bcf.switch.Switch object at 0x10f3ec4d0>, <pybsn.bcf.switch.Switch object at 0x10f3ec610>, <pybsn.bcf.switch.Switch object at 0x10f3ec750>, <pybsn.bcf.switch.Switch object at 0x10f3ec890>, <pybsn.bcf.switch.Switch object at 0x10f3ec9d0>, <pybsn.bcf.switch.Switch object at 0x10f3ecb10>, <pybsn.bcf.switch.Switch object at 0x10f3ecc50>, <pybsn.bcf.switch.Switch object at 0x10f3ecd90>, <pybsn.bcf.switch.Switch object at 0x10f3eced0>, <pybsn.bcf.switch.Switch object at 0x10f3f6050>, <pybsn.bcf.switch.Switch object at 0x10f3f6190>, <pybsn.bcf.switch.Switch object at 0x10f3f62d0>]

for sw in switches:
   sw.disconnect()
```
