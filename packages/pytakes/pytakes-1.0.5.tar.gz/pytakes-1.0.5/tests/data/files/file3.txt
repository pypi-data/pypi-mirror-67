At this time, when the greatest persecutions were exciting Asia, Polycarp ended his life
by martyrdom. But I consider it most important that his death, a written account of which is still
extant, should be recorded in this history.

 There is a letter, written in the name of the church over which he himself presided, to the
parishes in Pontus, which relates the events that befell him, in the following words:
 "The church of God which dwelleth in Philomelium, and to all the parishes of the holy
catholic Church in every place; mercy and peace and love from God the Father be multiplied.
We write unto you, brethren, an account of what happened to those that suffered martyrdom and
to the blessed Polycarp, who put an end to the persecution, having, as it were, sealed it by his
martyrdom."
 After these words, before giving the account of Polycarp, they record the events which befell
the rest of the martyrs, and describe the great firmness which they exhibited in the midst of their
pains. For they say that the bystanders were struck with amazement when they saw them lacerated
with scourges even to the innermost veins and arteries, so that the hidden inward parts of the body,
both their bowels and their members, were exposed to view; and then laid upon sea-shells and
certain pointed spits, and subjected to every species of punishment and of torture, and finally thrown
as food to wild beasts.
 And they record that the most noble Germanicus especially distinguished himself,
overcoming by the grace of God the fear of bodily death implanted by nature. When indeed the
proconsul wished to persuade him, and urged his youth, and besought him, as he was very young
and vigorous, to take compassion on himself, he did not hesitate, but eagerly lured the beast toward
himself, all but compelling and irritating him, in order that he might the sooner be freed from their
unrighteous and lawless life.
 After his glorious death the whole multitude, marveling at the bravery of the God-beloved
martyr and at the fortitude of the whole race of Christians, began to cry out suddenly, "Away with
the atheists; let Polycarp be sought."
 And when a very great tumult arose in consequence of the cries, a certain Phrygian, Quintus
by name, who was newly come from Phrygia, seeing the beasts and the additional tortures, was
smitten with cowardice and gave up the attainment of salvation.
 But the above-mentioned epistle shows that he, too hastily and without proper discretion,
had rushed forward with others to the tribunal, but when seized had furnished a clear proof to all,
that it is not right for such persons rashly and recklessly to expose themselves to danger. Thus did
matters turn out in connection with them.
 But the most admirable Polycarp, when he first heard of these things, continued undisturbed,
preserved a quiet and unshaken mind, and determined to remain in the city. But being persuaded
by his friends who entreated and exhorted him to retire secretly, he went out to a farm not far distant
from the city and abode there with a few companions, night and day doing nothing but wrestle with
the Lord in prayer, beseeching and imploring, and asking peace for the churches throughout the
whole world. For this was always his custom.
 And three days before his arrest, while he was praying, he saw in a vision at night the pillow
under his head suddenly seized by fire and consumed; and upon this awakening he immediately
interpreted the vision to those that were present, almost foretelling that which was about to happen,
and declaring plainly to those that were with him that it would be necessary for him for Christ's
sake to die by fire.
 Then, as those who were seeking him pushed the search with vigor, they say that he was
again constrained by the solicitude and love of the brethren to go to another farm. Thither his
pursuers came after no long time, and seized two of the servants there, and tortured one of them
for the purpose of learning from him Polycarp's hiding-place.
 And coming late in the evening, they found him lying in an upper room, whence he might
have gone to another house, but he would not, saying, "The will of God be done."
 And when he learned that they were present, as the account says, he went down and spoke
to them with a very cheerful and gentle countenance, so that those who did not already know the
man thought that they beheld a miracle when they observed his advanced age and the gravity and
firmness of his bearing, and they marveled that so much effort should be made to capture a man
like him.
 But he did not hesitate, but immediately gave orders that a table should be spread for them.
Then he invited them to partake of a bounteous meal, and asked of them one hour that he might
pray undisturbed. And when they had given permission, he stood up and prayed, being full of the
grace of the Lord, so that those who were present and heard him praying were amazed, and many
of them now repented that such a venerable and godly old man was about to be put to death.
 In addition to these things the narrative concerning him contains the following account:
"But when at length he had brought his prayer to an end, after remembering all that had ever come
into contact with him, small and great, famous and obscure, and the whole catholic Church
throughout the world, the hour of departure being come, they put him upon an ass and brought him
to the city, it being a great Sabbath. And he was met by Herod, the captain of police, and
by his father Nicetes, who took him into their carriage, and sitting beside him endeavored to persuade
him, saying, 'For what harm is there in saying, Lord Cæsar, and sacrificing and saving your life?'
He at first did not answer; but when they persisted, he said, 'I am not going to do what you advise
me.'
 And when they failed to persuade him, they uttered dreadful words, and thrust him down
with violence, so that as he descended from the carriage he lacerated his shin. But without turning
round, he went on his way promptly and rapidly, as if nothing had happened to him, and was taken
to the stadium.
 But there was such a tumult in the stadium that not many heard a voice from heaven, which
came to Polycarp as he was entering the place: 'Be strong, Polycarp, and play the man.' And no
one saw the speaker, but many of our people heard the voice.
 And when he was led forward, there was a great tumult, as they heard that Polycarp was
taken. Finally, when he came up, the proconsul asked if he were Polycarp. And when he confessed
that he was, he endeavored to persuade him to deny, saying, 'Have regard for thine age,' and other
like things, which it is their custom to say: 'Swear by the genius of Cæsar; repent and say, Away
with the Atheists.'
 But Polycarp, looking with dignified countenance upon the whole crowd that was gathered
in the stadium, waved his hand to them, and groaned, and raising his eyes toward heaven, said,
'Away with the Atheists.'
But when the magistrate pressed him, and said, 'Swear, and I will release thee; revile Christ,'
Polycarp said, 'Fourscore and six years have I been serving him, and he hath done me no wrong;
how then can I blaspheme my king who saved me?'
