Description: # unitty
        
        Unitty (pronounced 'unity') provides units when you need them, not when you
        don't. It's based on a phiolosophy that:
        
        * Units are useful for inputs
        * Units are useful for outputs (e.g. reports, plots)
        * Calculations are done in SI units, so units are not needed unless checking.
        * Unittests are used to encompass dimensional checks. Dimensional checks
        themselves are insufficient.
        * Quantities are named adequately in the code (e.g. 'area', 'length', 'mass').
        The kind of quantity they represent is clear from their names, and so 
        representing it elsewhere is typically redundant. 
        
        Unitty provides a flexible, lightweight package to:
        
        * Convert numbers to and from different units
        * Create derivative units
        * Automatically switch outputs to a different unit system, without changing
        any code.
        * Bundle values together with units for downstream use (e.g. reports, plots). 
        
        It is built on the idea that units provide scale factors to convert numbers
        to and from values in SI base units. Since SI base units all have magnitudes of
        1.0, unit information need not be in the calculations themselves.
        
        ## Quick start
        
        
        ## Alternatives
        
        Several other packages might be better suited to your particular needs. Here
        are some to consider:
        
        * numericalunits: Units and dimensional analysis compatible with everything
        * pint: Define, operate and manipulate physical quantities.
        * quantiphy: Pairs numbers and units.
        * astropy.units
        * Buckingham
        * DimPy
        * Magnitude
        * Python-quantities
        * Scalar
        * Scientific.Physics.PhysicalQuantities
        * SciMath
        * sympy.physics.units
        * udunitspy
        * Units
        * Unum
