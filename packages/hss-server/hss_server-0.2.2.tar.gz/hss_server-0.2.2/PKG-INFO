Description: # Hermes Skill Server
        
        Intent handling based on modular skills written in python. Intents are supplied from the voice assistant via Hermes MQTT protocol.
        
        ```
        Voice Assistant   <=== mqtt ===>   hss-server   <===>   hss-skill
        ```
        
        Compatible with the [Rhasspy voice assistant](https://github.com/synesthesiam/rhasspy).
        
        ## Installation
        
        The server is preferably installed within a virtualenv, and requires python >=3.6.
        
        ```
        /home/s710 $> mkdir hss
        /home/s710 $> cd hss
        /home/s710/hss $> mkdir hss
        /home/s710/hss $> python3.7 -m venv /home/s710/hss/venv
        
        /home/s710/hss $> source venv/bin/activate
        (venv) /home/s710/hss $> pip install hss_server
        
        ```
        
        Afterwards the server can be run:
        
        ```
        (venv) /home/s710/hss $> hss-server
        INFO:hss: Hermes Skill Server v1.0.0
        INFO:hss: Using config dir '/home/s710/.config/hss_server'
        INFO:hss: Loading skills from '/home/s710/.config/skills'
        INFO:hss_server.skillserver: Loading skills ...
        INFO:hss_server.collection: Initializing skills ...
        INFO:hss_server.collection: Skill 'hss-skill-s710-weather' loaded
        INFO:hss_server.collection: Loaded 1 skill
        INFO:hss_server.skillserver: Connecting to MQTT server ...
        INFO:hss_server.mqtt: Connected to 10.0.50.5:1883

        INFO:hss_server.mqtt: Subscribing to topic 'hermes/intent/#' ...
        ```
        
        After the initial start, `hss-server` creates its configuration file (`[USER_CONFIG_DIR]/hss_server/config.ini`). The config file will contain the location where skills are installed, which by default is `[USER_CONFIG_DIR]/hss_server/skills`.
        
        On Linux, the `USER_CONFIG_DIR` will be `~/.config`, on MacOS it will be `~/Library/Application Support`.
        
        ## Updating
        
        Just simply use `pip` again to update:
        
        ```
        /home/s710 $> cd hss
        /home/s710/hss $> source venv/bin/activate
        (venv) /home/s710/hss $> pip install hss_server --upgrade
        
        ```
        
        ## Features
        
        The server opens a connection to the given MQTT broker, and listens on the intent-topics (by default: `hermes/intent/#`).
        Also, all available skills from the skills directory will be loaded, each skill as own process with its own virtualenv.
        
        For every incoming intent which is published via MQTT, the skill-server tries to find a matching skill, and, if found, hands the intent over to the skill so it can be handled. If the skill implements a response text, then this text will be returned via MQTT to the TTS topic (by default: `hermes/tts/say`).
        
        Each skill is running in its own python virtualenv, with its own python dependencies and configuration. Skills can be installed easily from a git repository using the `hss-cli` tool.
        
        
        ## Options
        
        ```
        Usage:
           $ ./hss-server [-dhv][-hptTurcl arg]
        
        Options:
        
           -h [host]          MQTT host to connect to (default: localhost)
           -p [port]          MQTT port (default: 1883)
           -t [topic]         MQTT topic to listen on (default: hermes/intent/#)
        
           -T [topic]         MQTT topic to publish TTS to (default: hermes/tts/say)
           -u [url]           URL to post TTS to. If set, TTS is not sent via MQTT (default: None)
        
           -r [port]          Starting port for RCP communication (default: 51000)
        
           -c [dir]           Directory path where the server's config.ini is located (default: user config dir)
        
           -l [file]          Log file to write log entries to (default: console)
           -d                 Enable debug log output
        
           --help             Show this help and exit
           -v, --version      Show version and exit
        ```
        
        The options `-h`/`-p`/`-t`/`-T` are needed for MQTT communication with the voice assistant.
        
        The option `-u` switches the text-to-speech output from MQTT to HTTP, in case the voice assistant does not support MQTT-based TTS messages. For rhasspy <= 2.4, this should be set to `http://[RHASSPYHOST]:12101/api/text-to-speech`.
        
        The `-r` option denotes the beginning of the dynamic RPC port range, and should not be changed unless there are issues with other services.
        
        # CLI
        
        The `hss-cli` tool is used to:
        
        - list all installed skills
        - install a skill
        - uninstall a skill
        - update one or all installed skills
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```
        Usage:
           $ ./hss-cli [-lhv][-iur arg]
        
        Options:
        
           -l              List all installed skills.
        
           -i [url]        Install a new skill using [url]. [url] must be a valid GIT link.
           -u ([name])     Update an already installed skill named [name].
                           If [name] is ommited, ALL skills will be updated.
        
           -r [name]       Uninstall an already installed skill named [name]
        
           -h, --help      Show this help and exit
           -v, --version   Show version and exit
        ```
        
        ### Installing
        
        When installing skills, the GIT repository URL must be given. The repository name is considered to be the skill-name, and will be the subdirectory name within the skills-directory.
        
        Installing a skill involves the following steps:
        
        - cloning the remote repository
        - creating a virtualenv
        - installing dependencies given by the skill developer (`requirements.txt`)
        - asking the user for configuration parameters, if the skill provides the `config.ini.default` file
        
        The server must be restarted after installing a new skill.
        
        ### Updating
        
        Updating one or more skills is as easy as pulling changes from the remote GIT repository of the skill.
        
        In addition, `hss-cli` will compare the existing `config.ini` (if it exists) with a new `config.ini.default`, to detect newly added configuration parameters, and then prompt the user for the parameters.
        
        ### Uninstalling
        
        Uninstalling simply leads to the deletion of the skill's subfolder within the skill-directory. No other actions involved.
