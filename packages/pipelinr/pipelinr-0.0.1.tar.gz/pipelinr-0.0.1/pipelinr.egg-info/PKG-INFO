Description: # pipelinr
        An effective task engine.
        
        # What is Pipelinr?
        
        A todo engine. It's goal is to read as fast as possible a classical 
        todolist writed down on a file and to deliver the last tasks actionables.
        
        # How do I use it?
        
        You have to write a file more or less like this:
        
        ```
        # project
        1. c
         - do this first
        2. b
         - c
         - d
          1. do this
           1. do this before
           2. do that after 1.
          - do x when you want
          - do y same time
           - this has to be done prior to y
        etc.
        ```
        
        Save your file as 'todo' or other custom name. If you saved your file 
        as 'todo', mv in the file folder in command line and then execute pipelinr 
        without argument:
        
        ```
        cd mydir
        touch todo
        vim todo
        pipelinr
        ```
        
        You can also open a specific file:
        ```
        pipelinr -f my_specific_file
        ```
        
        By doing so, Pipelinr will display a bunch of *actionable tasks*
        
        Each task in the list is a task you should do first.
