# pipelinr
An effective task engine.

# What is Pipelinr?

A todo engine. It's goal is to read as fast as possible a classical 
todolist writed down on a file and to deliver the last tasks actionables.

# How do I use it?

You have to write a file more or less like this:

```
# project
1. c
 - do this first
2. b
 - c
 - d
  1. do this
   1. do this before
   2. do that after 1.
  - do x when you want
  - do y same time
   - this has to be done prior to y
etc.
```

Save your file as 'todo' or other custom name. If you saved your file 
as 'todo', mv in the file folder in command line and then execute pipelinr 
without argument:

```
cd mydir
touch todo
vim todo
pipelinr
```

You can also open a specific file:
```
pipelinr -f my_specific_file
```

By doing so, Pipelinr will display a bunch of *actionable tasks*

Each task in the list is a task you should do first.
