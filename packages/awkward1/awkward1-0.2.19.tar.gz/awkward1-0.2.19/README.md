Awkward Array is a library for **nested, variable-sized data**, including arbitrary-length lists, records, mixed types, and missing data, using **NumPy-like idioms**.

Arrays are **dynamically typed**, but operations on them are **compiled and fast**. Their behavior coincides with NumPy when array dimensions are regular and generalizes when they're not.

# Installation

Awkward Array can be installed [from PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/awkward1/) using pip:

```bash
pip install awkward1
```

Most users will get a precompiled binary (wheel) for your operating system and Python version. If not, the above attempts to compile from source.

   * Report bugs, request features, and ask for additional documentation on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/issues). If you have a general "How do Iâ€¦?" question, we'll answer it as a new [example in the tutorial](https://awkward-array.org/how-to.html).
   * If you have a problem that's too specific to be new documentation or it isn't exclusively related to Awkward Array, it might be more appropriate to ask on [StackOverflow with the [awkward-array] tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/awkward-array). Be sure to include tags for any other libraries that you use, such as Pandas or PyTorch.
   * The [Gitter Scikit-HEP/community](https://gitter.im/Scikit-HEP/community) is a way to get in touch with all Scikit-HEP developers and users.

## Installation for developers

Be sure to clone this repository recursively to get the header-only C++ dependencies.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0.git
```

You can install it on your system with pip, which uses exactly the same procedure as deployment. This is recommended if you **do not** expect to change the code.

```bash
pip install .[test,dev]
```

Or you can build it locally for incremental development. The following reuses a local directory so that you only recompile what you've changed. This is recommended if you **do** expect to change the code.

```bash
python localbuild.py --pytest tests
```

   * [Continuous integration](https://dev.azure.com/jpivarski/Scikit-HEP/_build?definitionId=3&_a=summary) and [continuous deployment](https://dev.azure.com/jpivarski/Scikit-HEP/_build?definitionId=4&_a=summary) are hosted by Azure Pipelines.
   * [Release history](https://awkward-array.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_auto/changelog.html) (changelog) is hosted by ReadTheDocs.
   * [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) provides more information on how to contribute.
   * [LICENSE](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/blob/master/LICENSE) is BSD-3.

## Using Awkward Array as a dependency

Python projects can simply `import awkward1`.

C++ projects can link against the shared libraries `libawkward-cpu-kernels.so` and `libawkward.so` or their static library equivalents. These libraries are shipped, along with the include files, as part of pip's installation.

   * See the [dependent-project](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward-1.0/tree/master/dependent-project) directory for examples.
