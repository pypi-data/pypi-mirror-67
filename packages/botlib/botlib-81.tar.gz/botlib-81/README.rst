BOTLIB is a library you can use to program bots. no copyright. no LICENSE.


I N S T A L L


you need to install python3-setuptools and python3-feedparser yourself.


download the tarball from pypi, https://pypi.org/project/botlib/#files

extract the tarball, cd into the directory and run the following:

::

 > sudo python3 setup.py install


you can also download with pip3 and install globally.

::

 > sudo pip3 install botlib --upgrade --force-reinstall

run the bin/install script, this will install binaries in /usr/local/bin/
and installs a botd.service file in /etc/systemd/system.

::

 > sudo bin/install

you can easy configure the bot with the bin/cfg program

::

 > sudo bin/cfg irc.freenode.net \#dunkbots mybot

lastly you can use the bothup program to restart the service.

::

 > sudo bothup

done ! the bot should be started on reboot.

BOTLIB is a pure python3 library and does not install binaries. 


C O D I N G


if you want to develop on the library clone the source at bitbucket.org:

::

 > git clone https://bitbucket.org/botd/botlib

if you want to add your own modules to the bot, you can put you .py files in a "mods" directory and use the -m option to point to that directory.

BOTLIB contains the following modules:

::

    bot.dft		- default
    bot.flt		- fleet
    bot.irc		- irc bot
    bot.krn		- core handler
    bot.rss		- rss to channel
    bot.shw		- show runtime
    bot.udp		- udp to channel
    bot.usr		- users

BOTLIB uses the LIBOBJ library which gets included in the tarball.

::

    lo.clk		- clock
    lo.csl		- console 
    lo.gnr		- generic
    lo.hdl		- handler
    lo.shl		- shell
    lo.thr		- threads
    lo.tms		- times
    lo.trc		- trace
    lo.typ		- types

basic code is a function that gets an event as a argument:

::

 def command(event):
     << your code here >>

to give feedback to the user use the event.reply(txt) method:

::

 def command(event):
     event.reply("yooo %s" % event.origin)


have fun coding ;]
