thread_task is built on top of
[threading](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/threading.html "threading package")
and allows to organize tasks and run them parallel. You can:
- build chains of tasks, which execute tasks sequentially in a single thread
- build parent child dependencies, which allows to construct trees of tasks
- stop tasks, which also stops the execution of child tasks
- continue tasks, which also continues the execution of child tasks
- restart finished or stopped tasks
- join tasks, which means waiting until the task and its children are finished

A thread_task is not like a function, it doesn't return results. Think
of it as an instruction to a reliable but independently acting
person. If feedback is needed, this can be done by callback
functions. You can also use mutable objects, which tasks get in
as arguments.

The following task types exist:
- Task: Executes a single task or a chain of tasks
- Repeated: Executes a task multiple times.
- Periodic: Executes a task periodically
- Sleep: sleeps for a given time, is similar to time.sleep, but can be stopped and continued
