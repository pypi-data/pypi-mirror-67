        # Conductor-Maya
        
        Conductor-Maya is Maya plugin that contains a Submitter for the Conductor Cloud rendering service.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Conductor-Maya. 
        
        ```bash
        pip install conductor.maya 
        ```
        You can install conductor.maya either globally or in a [virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/). In either case, after installation, you'll need to create a module file to let Maya know where it is installed. 
        
        Run the following script to automatically create a Maya module file.
        
        ```bash
        setup_maya
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        The plugin provides a **conductorRender** node to submit rendering jobs based on values in Maya's **RenderSettings** node.
        
        #### To set up a render:
        * Open a scene that's ready to render.
        * Use the Plugin Manager to load the Conductor plugin. A Conductor Menu will appear in the main menu bar.
        * Choose **Conductor->Submitter->Create**.
        * In the attribute editor, press **Connect to Conductor** and sign in if necessary.
        * Choose an instance type and set up other parameters as required.
        * Press submit.
