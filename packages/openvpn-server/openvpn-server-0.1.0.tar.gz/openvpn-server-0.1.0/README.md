# Project Goals
This project provides Python package for managing [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/community-resources/how-to/) instances through their entire life cycle.  
It can be useful for setting up [CTF](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/) challenges or various [labs (be it home or development)](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/) to provide access to separated network or [VLANs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN).

# Docs
Autogenerated docs can be seen at https://openvpn-server.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

# Additional system requirements
1. Installed OpenVPN
1. User needs to be able to elevate privileges when executing `openvpn` binary seamlessly, with no password  
For example, when using sudo you can use `visudo` to add this line and allow user `vpnmaster` do just that.  
`vpnmaster  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/openvpn`
