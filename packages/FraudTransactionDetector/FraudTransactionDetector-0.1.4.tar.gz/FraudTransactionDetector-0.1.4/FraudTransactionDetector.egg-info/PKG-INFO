Description: ==========================
        Fraud Transaction Detector
        ==========================
        
        The objective of this project is to come up with a classfication machine 
        learning model which identifies anomaly data/records from genuine data/records 
        given unclassified/unlabeled data as input. This generic objective has 
        application in lot of domains like Healthcare, Stocks Trading, Banking, 
        System Security etc. and few of the use cases are as below:
        
        * Fradulent Medical Claim detection
        * Fradulent Credit Card Transactions
        * Early detection of insider trading
        * Intrusion detection
        
        Technologies used
        =================
        
        As the module needs to be scalable and handle Big Data involving 
        Hundreds of Millions of records, I have chosen to use 
        
        * Apache Spark
        * H2o
        
        My Approach
        ===========
        Below is the approach taken and algorithms used to solve the problem 
        at hand:
        
        1. K-Means Clustering from Apache Spark MLlib
            * To identify clusters in the given unlabeled data
            * Handles Big Data and scales on a cluster of machines
        
        2. Isolation Forest from H2o
            * To detect the Anamolies in each cluster identified in #1
            * Handles Big Data and works seamlessly with Apache Spark
        
        3. Gradient Boosted Classification Trees from Spark MLlib 
            * To create Ensemble classification model
            * Handles Big Data and scales on a cluster of machines
        
        4. Model optimization using Apache Spark MLlib CrossValidator
        
        5. PCA
            * Dimensionality Reduction to visualize the data in 3D
        
        How to import and use the package?
        ==================================
        Below is the sample usage::
        
        	from fraudtransactiondetector import FraudTransactionClassifier
        	classifier = FraudTransactionClassifier(numClusters=num_clusters,
                	                                quantile=0.99)
        
        	classifier.fit(df)
        	print(classifier.modelValidationMetrics())
        
        	# Apply it on entire Training data just to check
        	results = classifier.transform(df)
        
        	# Apply PCA and Visualize
        	classifier.visualizeByApplyingPCA()
        
        	# Select optimal number of clusters using Elbow Method
        	classifier.selectOptimalClusters(df)
        
        Software Requirements
        =====================
        Before installing the package, please ensure that the following softwares are 
        installed:
        
            * Apache Spark 2.4.3 toward pyspark
            * Java (JDK 8)
        
        Along with the package, the below packages will be installed when you 
        do 'pip install FraudTransactionDetector':
        
            * h2o == 3.30.0.1
            * pandas == 0.25.1
            * numpy == 1.16.5
            * matplotlib == 3.1.3
            * scikit-learn == 0.21.3
