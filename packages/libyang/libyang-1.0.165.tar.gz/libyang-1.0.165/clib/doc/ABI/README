libyang ABI/API changes
=======================

Here is a script to build information about changes in libyang ABI/API
between its versions. Such an overview can help developers migrating from
one version to another. The script uses Andrey Ponomarenko's tools from ABI
Laboratory [1], so it is necessary to install these tools first. To do so,
you can use the automatic installer from [2]. Target must be 'abi-tracker'.

Note: Some others tools are used by the LVC toolset and not all of them are
      correctly checked, so be careful and check warnings and error
      messages (e.g. I have been missing correct version of ctags).

Then here is the 'abi.sh' to build ABI/API timeline for libyang. By default
it includes all the versions from the project start to the current devel
branch.

You can limit the number of included libyang versions via a number given
as a parameter to the script. For example

$ ./abi.sh 10

builds overview for the last 10 libyang versions.

Or you can compare only two specific libyang versions providing the version
numbers as script parameters:

$ ./abi.sh 0.4.0 0.5.20

The result is in all cases stored as 'timeline/libyang/index.html' file.
