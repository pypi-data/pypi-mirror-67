Description: # JCALG1
        
        A python module to interface with Jeremy Collake's [JCALG1](https://github.com/jeremycollake/jcalg1) compression algorithm.
        
        ## Getting started
        
        ### Installation
        
        Clone the github repo
        
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/CallMeAlexO/jcalg1.git
        cd jcalg1
        ```
        
        Then just install
        
        ```
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        ### Usage
        
        I planned to make JCALG1 as similar as possible to zlib, for consistancy. 
        There are two functions: `compress` and `decompress`. 
        
        ```python
        import jcalg1
        
        text = """
        Mary had a little lamb,
        Little lamb, little lamb,
        Mary had a little lamb
        Whose fleece was white as snow.
        
        And everywhere that Mary went,
        Mary went, Mary went,
        Everywhere that Mary went
        The lamb was sure to go.""".encode('utf-8')
        
        compressed = jcalg1.compress(text, level=9, skip_checksum=False)
        decompressed = jcalg1.decompress(compressed)
        
        print(decompressed == text)
        ```
