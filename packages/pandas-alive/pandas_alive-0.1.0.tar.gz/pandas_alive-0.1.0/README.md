# Pandas-Alive

Animated plotting extension for Pandas with Matplotlib

**Pandas-Alive** is intended to provide a plotting backend for animated [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) charts for [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) DataFrames, similar to the already [existing Visualization feature of Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/visualization.html).

With **Pandas-Alive**, creating stunning, animated visualisations is as easy as calling:

``` python
df.plot_animated()
```

## Inspiration

The inspiration for this project comes from:

- [bar_chart_race](https://github.com/dexplo/bar_chart_race) by [Ted Petrou](https://github.com/tdpetrou)
- [Pandas-Bokeh](https://github.com/PatrikHlobil/Pandas-Bokeh) by [Patrik Hlobil](https://github.com/PatrikHlobil)

`bar_chart_race` produces animations from DataFrames like:
