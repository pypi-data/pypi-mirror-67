dfoalgos has been tested with Python 2.7 and 3.6. The recommended version is
Python 3.x, because compatibility is reached by avoiding usage of xrange. So,
the code has a higher memory consumption under Python 2.

Everything in this package is pure Python. For a description of the contents
see DESCRIPTION.rst.


Changes
=======

0.6
---
* Moved the factory method ANMSimplexSearch to
  NelderMeadSimplexSearch.create_with_adaptive_params.
* Made it possible to process problems with tuples as objective values in the
  minimize functions (does not work with NMK). In this case the length of the
  tuple must be supplied in the argument "num_objectives".
* Bugfix: minimize now also accepts a custom initial simplex (optionally).

0.5
---
* Added a factory method for creating Nelder-Mead instances with adaptive
  (a.k.a. dimension-dependent) parameters. The parameters are chosen
  according to the formulas of Gao and Han.
* Added a simplex construction method proposed by Lixing Han.

0.4
---
* Fixed a bug in the NMKSimplexSearch where the direction vectors were
  unnecessarily transposed in the simplex gradient calculation. This was caused
  by Python being row-major, while Matlab uses column-major layout.

0.3
---
* Fixed a bug in the NMKSimplexSearch where alpha was recomputed in every
  iteration. Two options are now available: 1) only initial calculation,
  2) recalculation after every reorientation (see argument recalc_alpha).

0.2
---
* Added simplex construction methods originating from L.E. Pfeffer, J.C.
  Nash, and Spendley/Varadhan.
* Added Nelder-Mead variant with sufficient decrease condition and
  reorientation of the simplex by Kelley.
* Added a minimize function that mimics the SciPy interface to all optimization
  algorithms.

0.1
---
* Initial version containing two simplex searches (Spendley and Nelder-Mead)
  and a pattern search algorithm.
