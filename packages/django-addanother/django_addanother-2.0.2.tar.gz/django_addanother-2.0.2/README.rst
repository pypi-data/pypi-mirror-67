django-addanother provides you with add-another buttons for forms outside the Django administration interface. It also provides an optional integration with django-select2_.

See documentation_ for details.

django-addanother has been extracted from django-autocomplete-light v2, after noticing that other apps copied the same code, to ease community maintenance.
