    It deals with a single origin container, destination container and a single combination of equipment
    to move substances from the origin to the destination. It will initiate and suspend processes
    according to a number of specified conditions. To run an activity after it has been initialized call env.run()
    on the Simpy environment with which it was initialized.

    To check when a transportation of substances can take place, the Activity class uses three different condition
    arguments: start_condition, stop_condition and condition. These condition arguments should all be given a condition
    object which has a satisfied method returning a boolean value. True if the condition is satisfied, False otherwise.

    sites:  a list of dictionaries specifying which site objects should be constructed
    equipment: a list of dictionaries specifying which equipment objects should be constructed
    activities: list of dictionaries specifying which activities should be performed during the simulation

    Each of the values the sites and equipment lists, are a dictionary specifying "id", "name",
    "type" and "properties". Here "id" can be used to refer to this site / equipment in other parts of the
    configuration, "name" is used to initialize the objects name (required by core.Identifiable).
    The "type" must be a list of mixin class names which will be used to construct a dynamic class for the
    object. For example: ["HasStorage", "HasResource", "Locatable"]. The core.Identifiable and core.Log class will
    always be added automatically by the Simulation class.
    The "properties" must be a dictionary which is used to construct the arguments for initializing the object.
    For example, if "HasContainer" is included in the "type" list, the "properties" dictionary must include a "capacity"
    which has the value that will be passed to the constructor of HasContainer. In this case, the "properties"
    dictionary can also optionally specify the "level".

    Each of the values of the activities list, is a dictionary specifying an "id", "type", and other fields depending
    on the type. The supported types are "move", "single_run", "sequential", "conditional", and "delayed".
    For a "move" type activity, the dictionary should also contain a "mover", "destination" and can optionally contain
    a "moverProperties" dictionary containing an "engineOrder".
    For a "single_run" type activity, the dictionary should also contain an "origin", "destination", "loader", "mover",
    "unloader" and can optionally contain a "moverProperties" dictionary containing an "engineOrder" and/or "load".
    For a "sequential" type activity, the dictionary should also contain "activities". This is a list off activities
    (dictionaries as before) which will be performed until sequentially in the order in which they appear in the list.
    For a "conditional" type activity, the dictionary should also contain a "condition" and "activities", where the
    "activities" is another list of activities which will be performed until the event corresponding with the condition
    occurs.
    For a "delayed" type activity, the dictionary should also contain a "condition" and "activities", where the
    "activities" is another list of activities which will be performed after the event corresponding with the condition
    occurs.

    The "condition" of a "conditional" or "delayed" type activity is a dictionary containing an "operator" and one other
    field depending on the type. The operator can be "is_full", "is_empty", "is_done", "any_of" and "all_of".
    For the "is_full" operator, the dictionary should contain an "operand" which must be the id of the object (site or
    equipment) of which the container should be full for the event to occur.
    For the "is_empty" operator, the dictionary should contain an "operand" which must be the id of the object (site or
    equipment) of which the container should be empty for the event to occur.
    For the "is_done" operator, the dictionary should contain an "operand" which must the the id of an activity which
    should be finished for the event to occur. To instantiate such an event, the operand activity must already be
    instantiated. The Simulation class takes care of instantiating its activities in an order which ensures this is the
    case. However, if there is no such order because activities contain "is_done" conditions which circularly reference
    each other, a ValueError will be raised.
    For the "any_of" operator, the dictionary should contain "conditions", a list of (sub)conditions of which any must
    occur for the event to occur.
    For the "all_of" operator, the dictionary should contain "conditions", a list of (sub)conditions which all must
    occur for the event to occur.
