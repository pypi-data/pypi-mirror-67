# Notice how in test_relay_container_several_collectors, the delivery ship only takes 700 units on its second run, this
# is because it first reserves content, then "sails to its collection point, loads content, sails to the delivery point
# then delivers its content" (simulated by a single yield to a timeout for delivery_time). In Activity we could be a bit
# smarter about this and review the amount we wish to load once we've arrived at the loading site,
# if at that point more content is available, we could reserve any additional content and take this as well (provided
# there is more space in the ship and destination)
