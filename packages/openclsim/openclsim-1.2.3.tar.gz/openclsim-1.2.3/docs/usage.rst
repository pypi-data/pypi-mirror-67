Import required components
--------------------------

To use OpenCLSim in a project you have to import the following three components:

.. code:: python3

    # Import openclsim for the logistical components
    import openclsim.model as model
    import openclsim.core as core

    # Import simpy for the simulation environment
    import simpy


Using Mixins and Metaclasses
-----------------------------

The Open Complex Logistics Simulation package is developed with the goal of reusable and generic components in mind. A new class can be instatiated by combining mixins from the *openclsim.core*, such as presented below. The following lines of code demonstrate how a containervessel can be defined:

.. code:: python3

    # Define the core components
    # A generic class for an object that can move and transport material
    ContainerVessel = type('ContainerVessel', 
                        (core.Identifiable,             # Give it a name and unique UUID
                         core.Log,                      # Allow logging of all discrete events
                         core.ContainerDependentMovable,# It can transport an amount
                         core.HasResource,              # Add information on serving equipment
                         ),
                        {})
    
    # The next step is to define all the required parameters for the defined metaclass
    # For more realistic simulation you might want to have speed dependent on the filling degree
    v_full  = 8     # meters per second
    v_empty = 5     # meters per second

    def variable_speed(v_empty, v_full):
        return lambda x: x * (v_full - v_empty) + v_empty
    
    # Other variables
    data_vessel = {
               "env": simpy.Environment(),                   # The simpy environment 
               "name": "Vessel 01",                          # Name
               "geometry": shapely.geometry.Point(0, 0),     # The lat, lon coordinates
               "capacity": 5_000,                            # Capacity of the vessel 
               "compute_v": variable_speed(v_empty, v_full), # Variable speed 
               }
    
    # Create an object based on the metaclass and vessel data
    vessel_01 = ContainerVessel(**data_vessel)
