hyde-gopher
===========

Serve your `Hyde <https://hyde.github.io/>`__ site over
`Gopher <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)>`__. (This is
primarily made possible by
`flask-gopher <https://github.com/michael-lazar/flask-gopher>`__, yay.)

Installation
------------

Install the package via ``python3 -m pip install .`` or replace
``hyde-gopher`` with ``python3 -m hyde_gopher.main`` in the following
steps.

Usage
-----

Setup
~~~~~

As Gopher supports only absolute links and there's no such thing as a
``Host`` header, hyde-gopher needs to know the absolute base path of
your site when generating the static site. (If you're using the built-in
webserver this is currently being guessed from the bind configuration
which may lead to broken links. Please use the built-in webserver just
for local tests and not for internet-facing deployments.)

To do so, add the following line to your ``site.yaml``:

.. code:: yaml

    gopher_base_url: gopher://gopher.mysite.invalid:71/~user/

Serve
~~~~~

You can use the built-in webserver for a quick test - and also for
pre-viewing your site while editing it.

To do so, run ``hyde-gopher serve``.

Per default, this will serve the site from the current working directory
at gopher://localhost:7070/, placing generated files into
``deploy_gopher/``. (You can change this, see ``hyde-gopher -h`` and
``hyde-goper serve -h`` for more options.)

Generate
~~~~~~~~

The primary purpose of hyde-gopher is to generate a static site (just
like hyde's).

To do so, run ``hyde-gopher gen``.

Per default, this will generate a static version of the site from the
current working directory to the folder ``deploy_gopher/``. (You can
change this, see ``hyde-gopher -h`` and ``hyde-goper gen -h`` for more
options.)

Knonwn issues / TODO
--------------------

-  index pages look very meager
-  links in pages are not rendered as links
-  just HTML files and folders are considered
