Description: # cmcrameri
        
        This is a basic wrapper around Fabio Crameri's perceptually uniform colour maps
        
        http://www.fabiocrameri.ch/colourmaps.php
        
        Current version is based on Scientific Colourmaps Version 6.0.4 (06.01.2020)
        
        **Work in progress** Not ready for public use yet! I haven't made a package before. The eventual aim is for this repo to serve PyPI and anaconda
        
        To use these colourmaps, clone/download the repo, add the folder to your path then:
        ```python
        from cmcrameri import cm
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        import numpy as mp
        plt.pcolor(np.random.rand(10,10), cmap=cm.batlow) # or any of the other colourmaps made by Fabio Crameri
        ```
