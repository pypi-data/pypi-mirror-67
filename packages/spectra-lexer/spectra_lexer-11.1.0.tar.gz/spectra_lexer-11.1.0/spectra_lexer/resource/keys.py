                 ambiguity over sides even if the keys are in the wrong order.
        RTFCRE - Keys are all uppercase, hyphen delimits left vs. right side of the board.

                 Most steno dictionaries (i.e. for use in Plover) are in this format.
        String variables should be distinctly labeled as "skeys" when they use the first format.
        Characters from an outside source (JSON files or the Plover engine) are assumed to be RTFCRE. """
