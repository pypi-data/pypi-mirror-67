        **Texthero is a python toolkit that help you work with text-based dataset quickly and effortlessly**. Texthero is very simple to learn and designed to be used on top of Pandas.
        
        You can think of Texthero as a tool to help you _understand_ and work with text-based dataset. Given a tabular dataset, it's easy to _grasp the main concept_. Instead, given a text dataset it's harder to have quick insights of the underline data. With Texthero, preprocessing (cleaning), mapping words into vectors and visualize the reduced vector space takes only a couple lines of code.
        
        To use Texthero, you don't have to spend hours understanding complex and messy code. Texthero is composed of only three python modules *preprocessing.py*, *representation.py*, *visualization.py* and it's <a href="https://texthero.org/docs/getting-started">well documented</a>. Other than that, Texthero is optimized to be very fast.
        
        <h2 align="center">Installation</h2>
        
        Texthero is available on the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/texthero/" target="\_blank">Python Package Index</a> and can be installed via `pip`.
        
        ```bash
        pip install texthero
        ```
        
        > ‚òùÔ∏èUnder the hoods, Texthero makes use of multiple NLP and machine learning toolkits such as Gensim, NLTK, SpaCy and scikit-learn. You don't need to install them all separately, pip will take care of that for you.
        
        <h2 align="center">Getting started</h2>
        
        The best way to learn Texthero is probably via the <a href="">Getting Started</a> official documentation. In case you are a pro python user, then `help(texthero)` should suffices.
        
        <h2 align="center">Example</h2>
        
        
        
        ```python
        import texthero.texthero as hero
        import pandas as pd
        
        df = pd.DataFrame(["hello world", "hello", "world"], columns='text')
        df = hero.do_preprocess(df)
        df = hero.do_tfidf(df)
        df = hero.do_pca(df)
        hero.scatterplot(df)
        ```
        
        (The same example can also be found as a "getting-started guide" here: ...)
        
        <h2 align="center">API</h2>
        
        Texthero is composed of three modules: [preprocessing.py](/texthero/preprocessing.py), [representation.py](/texthero/representation.py) and [visualization.py](/texthero/visualization.py).
        
        <h3>‚öíÔ∏è 1. Preprocessing</h3>
        
        **Scope:** prepare the **text** data for further analysis.
        
        Complete documentation: [preprocessing](https://jbesomi.github.io/texthero/preprocessing.html)
        
        <h3>üìí 2. Representation</h3>
        
        **Job:** map text data into vectors and do dimensionality reduction.
        
        Supported representation algorithms:
        1. Term frequency, inverse document frequency (`do_tfidf`)
        3. Word2Vec from Gensim 
        4. GloVe 
        5. Transformers 
        
        Supported dimensionality reduction algorithms:
        1. Principal component analysis (`do_pca`)
        2. Non-negative matrix factorization (`do_nmf`)
        
        Complete documentation: [representation](https://jbesomi.github.io/texthero/representation.html)
        
        <h3>üîÆ 3. Visualization</h3>
        
        **Job:** collection of functions to both summarize the main facts regarding the data and visualize the results. This part is very opinionated and ideal for anyone that needs a quick solution to visualize on screen the text data for instance during a text exploratory data analysis (EDA).
        
        Most common functions:
           - Text scatterplot. Handy when coupled with dimensionality reduction algorithms such as pca.
           - Most common words
           - Most common words between two entities
