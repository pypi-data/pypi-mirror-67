BOTD is a IRC channel daemon serving 24/7 in the background, it installs it's own botd.service file and can thus survive reboots.
BOTD contains no copyright or LICENSE and is placed in the public domain.

download the tarball from pypi, https://pypi.org/project/botd/#files
untar the tarball and run this to install the bot daemon on your system.

::

 > cd botd-13
 > sudo python3 setup.py install

you can also download with pip3 and install globally:

::

 > sudo pip3 install botd --upgrade --force-reinstall


if you want the botd to start on boot after install run:

::

 > sudo cp botd.service /etc/systemd/system/botd.service
 > sudo botctl cfg <server> <channel> <nick> <owner>
 > sudo bothup

U S A G E

::

 > bot <cmd>		- executes a command

use "botctl cfg" (sudo) to edit on the system installed botd service.
IRC configuration uses the cfg command to edit server/channel/nick:

::

 > botctl cfg localhost #dunkbots botje ~bart@127.0.0.1


R S S

the rss plugin uses the feedparser package, you need to install that
yourself:

::

 > pip3 install feedparser

make sure you have bot.rss added to your cfg.modules:

::

 > botctl cfg krn modules bot.rss


 add an url:

 > botctl rss https://news.ycombinator.com/rss
 ok 1

 run the rss command to see what urls are registered:

 > botctl rss
 0 https://news.ycombinator.com/rss

 the fetch command can be used to poll the added feeds:

 > botctl fetch
 fetched 0


U D P


using udp to relay text into a channel, use the botudp program to send text via the bot 
to the channel on the irc server:

::

 > tail -f /var/log/botd/botd.log | botudp 

to send a message to the IRC channel, send a udp packet to the bot:

::

 import socket

 def toudp(host, port, txt):
     sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
     sock.sendto(bytes(txt.strip(), "utf-8"), host, port)

if you want to develop on the bot clone the source at bitbucket.org:

::

 > git clone https://bitbucket.org/botd/botd


BOTLIB contains the following modules:

::

    bot.dft             - default
    bot.flt             - fleet
    bot.irc             - irc bot
    bot.krn             - core handler
    bot.rss             - rss to channel
    bot.shw             - show runtime
    bot.udp             - udp to channel
    bot.usr             - users

BOTLIB uses the LIBOBJ library which gets included in the tarball.

::

    lo.clk              - clock
    lo.csl              - console 
    lo.hdl              - handler
    lo.shl              - shell
    lo.thr              - threads
    lo.tms              - times
    lo.trc		- trace
    lo.typ              - types

basic code is a function that gets an event as a argument:

::

 def command(event):
     << your code here >>

to give feedback to the user use the event.reply(txt) method:

::

 def command(event):
     event.reply("yooo %s" % event.origin)


have fun coding ;]
