        Parameters
        ----------
        network: Network
            The network on which to run the model
        infections: Infections
            The space used to record the infections
        rngs: list
            The list of random number generators to use, one per thread
        population: Population
            The initial population at the start of the model outbreak.
            This is also used to set the date and day of the start of
            the model outbreak
        seed: int
            The random number seed used for this model run. If this is
            None then a very random random number seed will be used
        output_dir: OutputFiles
            The directory to write all of the output into
        nsteps: int
            The maximum number of steps to run in the outbreak. If None
            then run until the outbreak has finished
        profile: bool
            Whether or not to profile the model run and print out the
            results
        profiler: Profiler
            The profiler to use to profile - a new one is created if
            one isn't passed
        s: int
            Index of the seeding parameter to use
        nthreads: int
            Number of threads over which to parallelise this model run
        iterator: function
            Function that will be used to dynamically get the functions
            that will be used at each iteration to advance the
            model. Any additional files or parameters needed by these
            functions should be included in the `network.params` object.
        extractor: function
            Function that will be used to dynamically get the functions
            that will be used at each iteration to extract data from
            the model run
