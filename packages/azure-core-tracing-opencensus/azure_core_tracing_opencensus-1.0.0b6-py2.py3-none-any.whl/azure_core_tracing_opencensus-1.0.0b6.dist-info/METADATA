# Azure Core Tracing OpenCensus client library for Python

## Getting started

Install the opencensus python for Python with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

```bash
pip install azure-core-tracing-opencensus --pre
```

Now you can use opencensus for Python as usual with any SDKs that is compatible
with azure-core tracing. This includes (not exhaustive list), azure-storage-blob, azure-keyvault-secrets, azure-eventhub, etc.

## Key concepts

* You don't need to pass any context, SDK will get it for you
* The opencensus threading plugin is installed with this package

## Examples

There is no explicit context to pass, you just create your usual opencensus and tracer and
call any SDK code that is compatible with azure-core tracing. This is an example
using Azure Monitor exporter, but you can use any exporter (Zipkin, etc.).

```python
from opencensus.ext.azure.trace_exporter import AzureExporter

from opencensus.trace.tracer import Tracer
from opencensus.trace.samplers import AlwaysOnSampler

from azure.storage.blob import BlobServiceClient

exporter = AzureExporter(
    instrumentation_key="uuid of the instrumentation key (see your Azure Monitor account)"
)

tracer = Tracer(exporter=exporter, sampler=AlwaysOnSampler())
with tracer.span(name="MyApplication") as span:
    client = BlobServiceClient.from_connection_string('connectionstring')
    client.delete_container('mycontainer')  # Call will be traced
```


## Troubleshooting

This client raises exceptions defined in [Azure Core](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/master/sdk/core/azure-core/docs/exceptions.md).


## Next steps

More documentation on OpenCensus configuration can be found on the [OpenCensus website](https://opencensus.io)
