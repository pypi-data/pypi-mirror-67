    This holds all the SQLite Logic.

    All lookups operate on a composite primary key,
    ensuring that the abstration has minimal runtime performance overhead.
    This does incur a small cost to the DB size, though this is acceptible.

    Interface is async despite the underlying code not being so.
    This is intentional, as if used as-is, without competeting on the same table
    with other applications, it should not block the event loop.

    Meanwhile, the interface being async consistently leaves room for drop in replacements
    which may actually utilize the async nature,
    or further features which might have the potential to be blocking

    There are a handful of computed SQL queries.
    These are limited against user input, and userinput is not allowed to be formatted in,
    with 1 exception of the table name.
    This name is restricted in nature as to be safe,
    and properly bracketed so that it is never seen as an SQL expression

    Changes to the computed queries should be done with caution to ensure this remains true.
    For additional peace of mind,
    you can choose to disallow user input from being used as part of the
    table_name at the application layer, which leaves all remaining potential user input
    inserted as parameters.
