AWS VPC Component for Pulumi
============================

*This is a project containing components for use
with*\ `Pulumi <https://pulumi.io>`__\ *, a tool for provisioning cloud
infrastructure based on a description written with general purpose
programming languages.*

This project provides a Pulumi component named ``Vpc``, which can be
used to create an `AWS
VPC <https://aws.amazon.com/answers/networking/aws-single-vpc-design/>`__
based on some of the good practices described by the AWS documentation,
posts made by AWS solutions engineers, and the experience of the package
author, contributors and reviewers.

For example, address space is assigned in an asymetric manner between
public and private subnets, as described in the article `Practical VPC
Design <https://medium.com/aws-activate-startup-blog/practical-vpc-design-8412e1a18dcc>`__.
VPC Endpoints for S3 and DynamoDB can optionally be configured, and flow
logging can be enabled if desired.

The ``Vpc`` component is implemented in both Node.js (using TypeScript)
and Python 3, with identical functionality and a very similar API
between the two languages. Both support Pulumi v2.1.0 and above.

This package does not currently support entirely private VPCs
(i.e.Â those without an internet gateway attached), though it is intended
to support such designs in future.

A
`CHANGELOG <https://github.com/jen20/pulumi-aws-vpc/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md>`__
is maintained for this project.
