* IDE setup: make sure my.config is in your package search path
In runtime, ~my.config~ is imported from the user config directory dynamically.

However, Pycharm/Emacs/whatever you use won't be able to figure that out, so you'd need to adjust your IDE configuration.

- Pycharm: basically, follow the instruction [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/55278260/706389][here]]

  i.e. create a new interpreter configuration (e.g. name it "Python 3.7 (for HPI)"), and add =~/.config/my=.

* Linting
You should be able to use ~./lint~ script to run mypy checks.

~mypy.ini~ file points at =~/.config/my= by default.
