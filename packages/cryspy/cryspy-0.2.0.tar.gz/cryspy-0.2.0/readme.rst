CrysPy
====================

CrysPy_ is a crystallographic library for neutron data analysis. Based on the library *CrysPy* a script *RhoChi* allows to refine polarized neutron diffraction experiments performed with single crystals as well as with powder magnetic compounds. A console version is given together with a simple GUI viewer.

Main Features
------------------------
- Analysis of the polarized neutron scattering on crystals by the library *CryPy*;
- Diffraction data refinement for single crystals or powder by *RhoChi*;

Installation and Requirements of *CrysPy*
------------------------------------------

CrysPy_ is developed and tested using Python 3.7 and depends on:

- *numpy*
- *scipy*
- *matplotlib*
- *pyqt5*.

It can be installed by

>>> python -m pip install cryspy  # as root (in Windows OS)


Or if you have downloaded a source tarball you can install CrysPy_ by doing the following:

>>> python setup.py develop # as root



Run *RhoChi*
------------------------------------------


The *CrysPy* library should be installed. 

Use the command-line to run the refinement in the folder which contents the data:

>>> python -m cryspy.run_rhochi

Collaboration
---------------------------

Any third-party scripts based on the library *CrysPy* can be added.
