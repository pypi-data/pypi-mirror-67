    """
This category allows the definition of local axes around each
atom in terms of vectors between neighbouring atoms.
High-resolution X-ray diffraction methods enable the
determination of the electron density distribution in crystal
lattices and molecules, which in turn allows for a
characterization of chemical interactions (Coppens, 1997;
Koritsanszky & Coppens, 2001). This is accomplished by the
construction of a mathematical model of the charge density
in a crystal and then by fitting the parameters of such a
model to the experimental pattern of diffracted X-rays. The
model on which this dictionary is based is the so-called
multipole formalism proposed by Hansen & Coppens (1978). In
this model, the electron density in a crystal is described
by a sum of aspherical "pseudoatoms" where the pseudoatom
density has the form defined in the _atom_rho_multipole_* items.
Each pseudoatom density consists of terms representing the
core density, the spherical part of the valence density and
the deviation of the valence density from sphericity. The
continuous electron density in the crystal is then modelled
as a sum of atom-centred charge distributions. Once the
experimental electron density has been established, the
"atoms in molecules" theory of Bader (1990) provides tools for
the interpretation of the density distribution in terms of its
topological properties.
