# BOOM
A C++ library for Bayesian modeling, mainly through Markov chain Monte Carlo, but with a few other methods supported.  
BOOM = "Bayesian Object Oriented Modeling".  It is also the sound your computer makes when it crashes.

The BOOM project began around 2005 while I was on the faculty at USC.  It continued during my time at Google.  Google claims 
copyright on modifications to BOOM files between 2009 and 2017.  Copyright for changes made either before or after that time 
is claimed by Steven L. Scott.
