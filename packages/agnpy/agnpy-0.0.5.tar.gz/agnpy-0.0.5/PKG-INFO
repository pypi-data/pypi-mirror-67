Description: # agnpy
        Modelling Active Galactic Nuclei radiative processes with python.
        
        ## descritpion
        `agnpy` focuses on the numerical computation of the photon spectra produced by leptonic radiative processes in jetted Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN).  
        
        ## documentation and quickstart
        You are invited to check the documentation at https://agnpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.    
        To get familiar with the code you can run the notebooks in `tutorials`.
        
        ## dependencies
        The only dependencies are:
        
        * [numpy](https://numpy.org) managing the numerical computation;
        
        * [astropy](https://www.astropy.org) managing physical units and astronomical distances.
        
        * [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) for visualisation and reproduction of the tutorials.
        
        ## installation
        The code is available in the [python package index](https://pypi.org/project/agnpy/) and can be installed via `pip`
        
        ```bash
        pip install agnpy
        ```
