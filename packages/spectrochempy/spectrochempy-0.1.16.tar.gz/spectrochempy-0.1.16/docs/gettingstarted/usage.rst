for **Chem**\istry with **Py**\thon and runs on Linux, Windows or OS X.
Among its major features, spectrochempy allows

* Import data from experiments or modeling programs with their *metatdata* (title, units, coordinates, ...)
* Preprocess these data: baseline correction, (automatic) subtraction, smoothing, apodization...
* Manipulate single or multiple datasets: concatenation, splitting, alignment along given dimensions, ...
* Explore data with exploratory analyses methods such as SVD, PCA, EFA and visualization capabilities ...
* Modelling single or multiple datasets with curve fitting / curve modelling (MCR-ALS) methods...
* Export data and analyses to various formats: *csv*, *xls*, *JCAMP-DX*,  ...
* Embed the complete workflow from raw data import to final analyses in a Project Manager
