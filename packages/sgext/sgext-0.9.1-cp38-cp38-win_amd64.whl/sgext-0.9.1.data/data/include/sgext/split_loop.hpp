/**
 * Split self-loop (node with an edge to itself) given the vertex_descriptor,
 * spatial_edge containing the edge_points, and the graph.
 * The graph will be modified adding an extra node in the position of the
 * median of the edge_points list.
 * The added node and the loop_vertex_id will be connected with two edges, each
 * containing half of the edge_points of the given sg_edge.
 *
 * Warning: it uses add_vertex, and add_edge so it can invalidate vertex and
 * edge descriptors, iterators etc if the graph uses a vector instead of a list
 * for storing vertices indices. See boost docs. For listS and vecS (undirected)
 * it only invalidates ALL adjacency_iterators.
 *
 * Also note that the adjacency_list must: allow_parallel_edge_tag. All
 * containers except setS and hash_setS allow it.
