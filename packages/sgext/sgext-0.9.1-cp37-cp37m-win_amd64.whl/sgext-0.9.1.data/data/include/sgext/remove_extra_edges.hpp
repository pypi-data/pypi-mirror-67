/**
 * Objects in DGtal with a 26_6 topology consider as adjacent vertices those
 * in diagonals. We are interested in keeping that topology, but it generates
 * spurious edges that confuses further analysis.
 * We remove the "diagonal" edges when there are shorter ones. Better an
 * example:
 *
 * o                  o
 * |\                 |
 * o-o      ----->    o-o
 * |/                 |
 * o                  o
 *
 * We are not interested in the diagonal edges, and better keep the center
 * node as the only 3-degree node.
 *
 * See related tests for further details.
 *
 * @param sg input spatial graph to reduce.
 *
 * @return boolean, true if any edge has been removed
 * false otherwhise.
