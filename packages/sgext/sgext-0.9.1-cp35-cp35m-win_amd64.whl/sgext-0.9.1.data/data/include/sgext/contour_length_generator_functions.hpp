/**
 * Given start and end point (in the simulation/real space), performs a
 * Montecarlo PERM simulation (in a 3D-26neighbors lattice), and transform the
 * generated chain into the simulation space.
 *
 * caveats:
 * - the way the transformation from lattice to real works, there is more
 * variance in the dimension where the differences between end and start point
 * are bigger.
 * - TODO: Maybe the amount of monomers and k_bending should depend on the
 *   end_to_end distance between end and start points.
 *   Some kind of monomer_density per unit of length. At the end, we are
 *   interested in the ratio contour_length / ete_distance. Please note that
 *   an increase in the number of monomers would need an increase of k_bending
 *   to keep the ratio contour/ete similar.
