To make things worse, in order to unapply\nDjango migrations, you have to enter the migration that comes right before the\nfirst migration of the current branch. It's not that big of a deal, Django is\nsmart enough to let you use an unambiguos prefix of any migration, but with\nthis package you can speed things up a little bit.\n\nWhile standing on any branch, you can use::\n\n    python manage.py unmigrate master\n\nOr if it's going to be ``master`` anyways, this will suffice::\n\n    python manage.py unmigrate\n\nAnd that's it!\n\nA little deeper\n---------------\n\nOk, you can do more than that.\n\nDo you need to unapply your migrations from the same branch, a few commits\nbehind? Here's how::\n\n    python manage.py unmigrate HEAD~5\n    python manage.py unmigrate af332b\n    python manage.py unmigrate v1.33.7\n\nIf you only want to see the target migrations::\n\n    python manage.py unmigrate --dry-run\n\nAnd if you just want to play with this, go ahead and unapply your migrations\nwith ``fake``. Just don't forget to apply them again::\n\n    python manage.py unmigrate --fake\n    python manage.py migrate --fake\n\n\nContributing\n------------\n\n- Join the discussion at https://gitter.im/django-unmigrate/community.\n- PRs are welcome! If you have questions or comments, please use the link\n  above.\n- To run the test suite run ``make`` or ``make coverage``. The tests for this\n  project live inside a small django project called ``dunm_sandbox``. Beware!\n  This package uses Git to function, therefore, the tests expect a number of\n  commit hashes inside this repository to remain stable in order to function.\n  See `this meta file`_ for further details.\n\n.. _this meta file: dunm_sandbox/meta.py\n",
