In order to unapply these migrations, you\nhave to enter the migration that comes right before the first migration of the\ncurrent branch. If more than one of your apps are involved, you will have to do\nthat for each one of them.\n\nIf you leave your migration names unchanged, inferring the name of the right\nmigration to target is not too difficult - Django is smart enough to let you use\nan unambiguous prefix of any migration name. But if you have renamed your\nmigrations as `this article`_ recommends, then you need to do the searching\nmanually.\n\n.. _this article: https://adamj.eu/tech/2020/02/24/how-to-disallow-auto-named-django-migrations/\n\nWith ``django-unmigrate`` you can speed up the process.\nWhile standing on any branch, you can use::\n\n    python manage.py unmigrate master\n\nOr if it's going to be ``master`` anyways, this will suffice::\n\n    python manage.py unmigrate\n\nAnd that's it!\n\nA little deeper\n---------------\n\nOk, you can do more than that.\n\nDo you need to unapply your migrations from the same branch, a few commits\nbehind? Here's how::\n\n    python manage.py unmigrate HEAD~12\n    python manage.py unmigrate b13553d\n    python manage.py unmigrate v1.33.7\n\nIf you only want to see the target migrations::\n\n    python manage.py unmigrate --dry-run\n\nAnd if you just want to play with this, go ahead and unapply your migrations\nwith ``fake``. Just don't forget to apply them again::\n\n    python manage.py unmigrate --fake\n    python manage.py migrate --fake\n\n\nContributing\n------------\n\n- Join the discussion at https://gitter.im/django-unmigrate/community.\n- PRs are welcome! If you have questions or comments, please use the link\n  above.\n- To run the test suite run ``make`` or ``make coverage``. The tests for this\n  project live inside a small django project called ``dunm_sandbox``. Beware!\n  This package uses Git to function, therefore, the tests expect a number of\n  commit hashes inside this repository to be present and remain stable in order\n  to function. See `this meta file`_ for further details.\n\n.. _this meta file: dunm_sandbox/meta.py\n",
