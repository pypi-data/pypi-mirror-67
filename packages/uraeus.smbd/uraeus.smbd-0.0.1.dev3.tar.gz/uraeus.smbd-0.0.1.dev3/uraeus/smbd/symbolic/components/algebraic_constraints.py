    **Abstract Class**
    
    A class that acts as a base class for algebraic constraints equations. The
    class is used to construct spatial joints connecting body pairs as well as
    actuators that acts on joints or bodies.

    ----------
    name : str
        Name of the joint instance. Should mimic a valid python variable name.
    body_i : body
        The 1st body isntance. Should be an instance of the `body` class.
    body_j : body
        The 2nd body isntance. Should be an instance of the `body` class.
