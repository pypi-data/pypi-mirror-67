Description:  KlopPy is a Python package providing deserializers for soccer tracking- and event data, and
        standardized data models designed to make working with different tracking- and event data like
        a breeze. It aims to be the fundamental building blocks for loading tracking- and event data.
        
        Here are just a few of the things that kloppy does well:
        - Understandable standardized models for tracking- and event datasets
        - Out-of-the-box deserializing tracking- and event data from different source into standardized models
        - Flexible pitch dimensions transformer for changing a dataset pitch dimensions from one to another (eg OPTA's 100x100 -> TRACAB meters)
        - Intelligent orientation transforming orientation of a dataset (eg from TRACAB fixed orientation to "Home Team" orientation)
