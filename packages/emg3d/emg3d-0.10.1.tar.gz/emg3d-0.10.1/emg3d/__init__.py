"""
Electromagnetic modeller in the diffusive limit (low frequencies) for 3D media
with tri-axial electrical anisotropy. The matrix-free multigrid solver can be
used as main solver or as preconditioner for one of the Krylov subspace methods
implemented in :mod:`scipy.sparse.linalg`, and the governing equations are
discretized on a staggered Yee grid. The code is written completely in Python
using the ``numpy``/``scipy``-stack, where the most time-consuming parts are
sped-up through jitted ``numba``-functions.
