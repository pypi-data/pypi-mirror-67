UVBeam Parameters
======================================
These are the standard attributes of UVBeam objects.

Under the hood they are actually properties based on UVParameter objects.

Required
----------------
These parameters are required to have a sensible UVBeam object and 
are required for most kinds of beam files.

**Naxes_vec**
     Number of basis vectors specified at each pixel, options are 2 or 3 (or 1 if beam_type is "power")

**Nfreqs**
     Number of frequency channels

**Nspws**
     Number of spectral windows (ie non-contiguous spectral chunks). More than one spectral window is not currently supported.

**antenna_type**
     String indicating antenna type. Allowed values are "simple", and "phased_array"

**bandpass_array**
     Frequency dependence of the beam. Depending on the data_normalization, this may contain only the frequency dependence of the receiving chain ("physical" normalization) or all the frequency dependence ("peak" normalization).

**beam_type**
     String indicating beam type. Allowed values are 'efield', and 'power'.

**data_array**
     Depending on beam type, either complex E-field values ('efield' beam type) or power values ('power' beam type) for beam model. Units are normalized to either peak or solid angle as given by data_normalization. The shape depends on the beam_type and pixel_coordinate_system, if it is 'healpix', the shape is: (Naxes_vec, Nspws, Nfeeds or Npols, Nfreqs, Npixels), otherwise it is (Naxes_vec, Nspws, Nfeeds or Npols, Nfreqs, Naxes2, Naxes1).

**data_normalization**
     Normalization standard of data_array, options are: "physical", "peak" or "solid_angle". Physical normalization means that the frequency dependence of the antenna sensitivity is included in the data_array while the frequency dependence of the receiving chain is included in the bandpass_array. Peak normalized means that for each frequency the data_arrayis separately normalized such that the peak is 1 (so the beam is dimensionless) and all direction-independent frequency dependence is moved to the bandpass_array (if the beam_type is "efield", then peak normalized means that the absolute value of the peak is 1). Solid angle normalized means the peak normalized beam is divided by the integral of the beam over the sphere, so the beam has dimensions of 1/stradian.

**feed_name**
     Name of physical feed (string)

**feed_version**
     Version of physical feed (string)

**freq_array**
     Array of frequencies, center of the channel, shape (Nspws, Nfreqs), units Hz

**history**
     String of history, units English

**model_name**
     Name of beam model (string)

**model_version**
     Version of beam model (string)

**pixel_coordinate_system**
     Pixel coordinate system, options are: "az_za", "orthoslant_zenith", "healpix". "az_za" is a uniformly gridded azimuth, zenith angle coordinate system, where az runs from East to North in radians. It has axes [azimuth, zen_angle]. "orthoslant_zenith" is a orthoslant projection at zenith where y points North, x point East. It has axes [zenorth_x, zenorth_y]. "healpix" is a HEALPix map with zenith at the north pole and az, za coordinate axes (for the basis_vector_array) where az runs from East to North. It has axes [hpx_inds].

**spw_array**
     Array of spectral window Numbers, shape (Nspws)

**telescope_name**
     Name of telescope (string)
