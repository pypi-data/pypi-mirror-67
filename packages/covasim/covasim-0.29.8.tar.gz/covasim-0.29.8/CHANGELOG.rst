What's new
==========

All notable changes to the codebase are documented in this file. Note: in many cases,
changes from multiple patch versions are grouped together, so numbering will not be
strictly consecutive.


Version 0.29.8 (2020-04-28)
---------------------------
- Update webapp UI with more detail on and control over interventions.


Version 0.29.7 (2020-04-27)
---------------------------
- New functions ``cv.date()`` and ``cv.daydiff()`` have been added, to ease handling of dates of different formats.
- Defaults are now functions rather than dictionaries, specifically: ``cv.default_sim_plots`` is now ``cv.get_sim_plots()``; ``cv.default_scen_plots`` is now ``cv.get_scen_plots()``; and ``cv.default_colors`` is now ``cv.get_colors()``.
- Interventions now have a ``do_plot`` kwarg, which if ``False`` will disable their plotting.
- The example scenario (``examples/run_scenario.py``) has been rewritten to include a test-trace-quarantine example.


Version 0.29.6 (2020-04-27)
---------------------------
- Updated to use Sciris v0.17.0, to fix JSON export issues and improve ``KeyError`` messages.


Version 0.29.5 (2020-04-26)
---------------------------
- Fixed bug whereby layer betas were applied twice, and updated default values.
- Includes individual-level viral load (to use previous results, set ``pars['beta_dist'] = {'dist':'lognormal','par1':1.0, 'par2':0.0}`` and ``pars['viral_dist']  = {'frac_time':0.0, 'load_ratio':1, 'high_cap':0}``).
- Updated parameter values (mostly durations) based on revised literature review.
- Added ``sim.export_pars()`` and ``sim.export_results()`` methods.
- Interventions can now be converted to/from JSON -- automatically when loading a parameters dictionary into a sim, or manually using ``cv.InterventionDict()``.
- Improvements to transmission trees: can now make a detailed tree with ``sim.people.make_detailed_transtree()`` (replacing ``sim.people.transtree.make_detailed(sim.people)``), and can plot via ``sim.people.transtree.plot()``.
- Improved date handling, so most functions are now agnostic as to whether a date string, datetime object, or number of days is provided; new functions: ``sim.day()`` converts dates to days, ``sim.date()`` (formerly ``sim.inds2dates()``) converts days to dates, and ``sim.daydiff()`` computes the number of days between two dates.


Version 0.28.8 (2020-04-24)
---------------------------
- Includes data on household sizes from various countries.
- Includes age data on US states.
- Changes to interventions to include end as well as start days, and plotting as a default option.
- Adds version checks to loading and introduces a new function ``cv.load()`` to replace e.g. ``cv.Sim.load()``.
- Major layout and functionality changes to the webapp, including country selection (disabled by default).
- Provided access to Plotly graphs via the backend.
- Moved relative probabilities (e.g. ``rel_death_prob``) from population creation to loop so can be modified dynamically.
- Introduced ``cv.clip_edges()`` intervention, similar to ``cv.change_beta()`` but removes contacts entirely.


Version 0.28.1 (2020-04-19)
---------------------------
- Major refactor of transmission trees, including additional detail via ``sim.people.transtree.make_detailed()``.
- Counting of diagnoses before and after interventions on each timestep (allowing people to go into quarantine on the same day).
- Improved saving of people in scenarios, and updated keyword for sims (``sim.save(keep_people=True)``).


Version 0.28.0 (2020-04-19)
---------------------------
- Includes dynamic per-person viral load.
- Refactored data types.
- Changed how populations are handled, including adding a ``dynam_layer`` parameter to specify which layers are dynamic.
- Disease progression duration parameters were updated to be longer.
- Fixed bugs with quarantine.
- Fixed bug with hybrid school and work contacts.
- Changed contact tracing to be only for contacts with nonzero transmission.


Version 0.27.12 (2020-04-17)
----------------------------
- Caches Numba functions, reducing load time from 2.5 to 0.5 seconds.
- Pins Numba to 0.48, which is 10x faster than 0.49.
- Fixed issue with saving populations in scenarios.
- Refactored how populations are handled, removing ``use_layers`` parameter (use ``pop_type`` instead).
- Removed layer key from layer object, reducing total sim memory footprint by 3x.
- Improved handling of mismatches between loaded population layers and simulation parameters.
- Added custom key errors to handle multiline error messages.
- Fix several issues with probability-based testing.
- Changed how layer betas are applied (inside the sim rather than statically).
- Added more detail to the transmission tree.
- Refactored random population calculation, speeding up large populations (>100k) by a factor of 10.
- Added `documentation <https://institutefordiseasemodeling.github.io/covasim-docs/>`__.


Version 0.27.0 (2020-04-16)
---------------------------
-  Refactor calculations to be vector-based rather than object based.
-  Include factors for per-person viral load (transmissibility) and
   susceptibility.
-  Started a changelog (needless to say).
