Description: MELODIST is an open-source toolbox written in Python for
        disaggregating daily meteorological time series to hourly time steps. The
        software framework consists of disaggregation functions for each variable
        including temperature, humidity, precipitation, shortwave radiation, and wind
        speed. These functions can simply be called from a station object, which
        includes all relevant information about site characteristics. The data
        management of time series is handled using data frame objects as defined in the
        pandas package. In this way, input and output data can be easily prepared and
        processed.
