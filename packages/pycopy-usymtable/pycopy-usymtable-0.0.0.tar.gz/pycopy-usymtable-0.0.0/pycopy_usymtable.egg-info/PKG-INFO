Description: This is a dummy implementation of a module for the standard library of
        Pycopy project (https://github.com/pfalcon/pycopy).
        It contains zero or very little functionality, and primarily intended to
        avoid import errors (using idea that even if an application imports a
        module, it may be not using it onevery code path, so may work at least
        partially). It is expected that more complete implementation of the module
        will be provided later. Please help with the development if you are
        interested in this module.
