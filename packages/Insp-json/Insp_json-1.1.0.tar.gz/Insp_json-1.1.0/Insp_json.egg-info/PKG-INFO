Description: The package 'Insp_json' converts a file(.py) specified in the form of path
        into java-script object notation format.In order to compute the things 
        throguh this package, your software must have the following
        imperative modules:
        1.json module .
        2.pathlib module .
        So, make sure the above written modules must be in the IDE or in the editor.
        In this package, you can generate a json formatteed file by just incepting 
        the operation of the program using the path pointing out the target file.
        Moreover, this package allows you to specify the path of that file which is
        generated after the processing.The path should be written in descriptive 
        manner which means that while entering the path in the terminal, you must
        write the complete path in order to demestify the things for the interpreter().
        For example:
        On windows operating system, the source file 'm' is in a folder say 'x' which is itself present in another folder 'y' and the folder 'y' is present in the local disk drive 'D'
        We can write the path by citing the following format in order to facilitate the steps:
        path = Path("d:\\y\\x\\m.type_of_format")
        where:
        'path' is an object storing the path of a specific file and
        'Path' is a class embedded in the pathlib module which is
        used by an interpreter to get the path of what is going to
        be processed in the future.
