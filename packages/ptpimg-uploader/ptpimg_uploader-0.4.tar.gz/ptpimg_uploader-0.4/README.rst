API key
-------

To find your PTPImg API key, login to https://ptpimg.me, open the page source
(i.e. "View->Developer->View source" menu in Chrome), find the string api_key
and copy the hexademical string from the value attribute. Your API key should
look like 43fe0fee-f935-4084-8a38-3e632b0be68c.

You can export your ptpimg.me API key (usually in .bashrc or .zshenv) using:

    export PTPIMG_API_KEY=<your hex key>

or use the ``-k`` / ``--api-key`` command-line switch.

How to use
----------

Run

    ptpimg_uploader -h

to get command-line help.

To upload an image file:

    ptpimg_uploader ~/seed/mytorrent/folder.jpg

To rehost an imgur image:

    ptpimg_uploader https://i.imgur.com/eaT6j3X.jpg

An uploaded URL will be printed to the console.

If ``--bbcode`` parameter is specified, URLS will be wrapped in BBCode ``[img]`` tags:

    ptpimg_uploader --bbcode ~/seed/mytorrent/folder.jpg

If pyperclip python package is installed, the URL will be additionally copied to the clipboard.

If output is a terminal, a bell will be ringed on completion (can be disabled with a ``--nobell`` parameter).

You can specify multiple files and URLs on the command line:

    ptpimg_uploader ~/seed/mytorrent/folder.jpg https://i.imgur.com/eaT6j3X.jpg

The resulting URLs are printed each on separate line, and copied to your
clipboard with newlines in between.
