Description: # Genetic Algorithm Framework
        
        The Genetic Algorithm Framework (GaFramework) is designed to be the simplest way to implement a genetic algorithm in Python 3. The framework is distributed as a Python package and allows a genetic algorithm based solution to be implemented in Python 3 using only a few lines of code.
        
        The GAF has been designed to be as generic and extensible as possible whilst at the same time being simple to use. The package contains all that is needed for many combinations of genetic algorithm. Many popular genetic operators are provided within the framework, in addition, external operators can be defined and added to the genetic algorithm process pipeline as required by the consumer.
