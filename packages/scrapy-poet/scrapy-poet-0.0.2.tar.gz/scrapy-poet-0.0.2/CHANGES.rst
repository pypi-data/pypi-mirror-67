Changes
=======

0.0.2 (2020-04-28)
------------------

The repository is renamed to ``scrapy-poet``, and split into two:

* ``web-poet`` (https://github.com/scrapinghub/web-poet) contains
  definitions and code useful for writing Page Objects for web
  data extraction - it is not tied to Scrapy;
* ``scrapy-poet`` (this package) provides Scrapy integration for such
  Page Objects.

API of the library changed in a backwards incompatible way;
see README and examples.

New features:

* ``DummyResponse`` annotation allows to skip downloading of scrapy Response.
* ``callback_for`` works for Scrapy disk queues if it is used to create
  a spider method (but not in its inline form)
* Page objects may require page objects as dependencies; dependencies are
  resolved recursively and built as needed.
* InjectionMiddleware supports ``async def`` and asyncio providers.


0.0.1 (2019-08-28)
------------------

Initial release.
