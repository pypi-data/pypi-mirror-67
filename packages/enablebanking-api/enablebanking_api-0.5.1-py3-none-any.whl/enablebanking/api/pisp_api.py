'\n    enable:Banking SDK\n\n    enable:Banking SDK consists of 4 interfaces:  - [Meta](#auth-api) provides information about available connectors; - [Auth](#auth-api) provides PSU (bank user) authentication and token creation   functionality; - [AISP](#aisp-api) provides functions for accessing account information, such as   transactions and balances, on behalf of a PSU; - [PISP](#pisp-api) provides functions for initiating and conforming payment   requests.  The same calls and data structures are used for interacting with different ASPSPs (banks). In order to use each of the interfaces corresponding instance needs to be created. When instantiating any of the interfaces except Meta, ASPSP connector name and settings need to be supplied. The settings differ from one connector to another (although many of them have the same properties) and are described in the [Connectors](#connectors-types) section of the documentation.  enable:Banking SDK interfaces are based on [STET PSD2 specification](https://www.stet.eu/en/psd2/), but have been modified and extended in order to support usage scenarious beyond the original specification.   # noqa: E501\n\n    API version: 0.5.1\n    Contact: hello@enablebanking.com\n    Generated by enable:Banking SDK generator using Swagger Codegen project\n'
