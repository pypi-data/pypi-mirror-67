Description: ## PyISY
        
        ### Python Library for the ISY Controller
        
        This library allows for easy interaction with ISY nodes, programs, variables, and the network module. This class also allows for functions to be
        assigned as handlers when ISY parameters are changed. ISY parameters can be
        monitored automatically as changes are reported from the device.
        
        **NOTE:** Significant changes have been made in V2, please refer to the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for details. It is recommended you do not update  to the latest version without testing for any unknown breaking changes or impacts to your dependent code.
