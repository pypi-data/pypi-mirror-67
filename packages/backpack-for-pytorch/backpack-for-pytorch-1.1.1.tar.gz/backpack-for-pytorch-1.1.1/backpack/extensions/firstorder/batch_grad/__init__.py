    Stores the output in ``grad_batch`` as a ``[N x ...]`` tensor,
    where ``N`` batch size and ``...`` is the shape of the gradient.

    Note: beware of scaling issue
        The `individual gradients` depend on the scaling of the overall function.
        Let ``fᵢ`` be the loss of the ``i`` th sample, with gradient ``gᵢ``.
        ``BatchGrad`` will return

        - ``[g₁, …, gₙ]`` if the loss is a sum, ``∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ fᵢ``,
        - ``[¹/ₙ g₁, …, ¹/ₙ gₙ]`` if the loss is a mean, ``¹/ₙ ∑ᵢ₌₁ⁿ fᵢ``.

    The concept of individual gradients is only meaningful if the
    objective is a sum of independent functions (no batchnorm).
