Description: # NWS CAP Parser (Python3)
        
        A Python module to make parsing National Weather Service (NWS) alerts simple.
        
        ## Common Alerting Protocol (CAP)
        
        The NWS publishes weather alerts and advisories in the CAP format via Atom feeds. More information - and a full list of US feeds - can be found on the NWS CAP [home page](http://alerts.weather.gov/).
        
        ## Module Details
        
        ### NWSCAPParser
        
        The nwscapparser module exports a single class, NWSCAPParser. Pass a string containing the XML from a CAP alert as the only param to the initialization call: `python from nwscapparser3 import NWSCAPParser filname = 'cap.IL124CA04A2F50.SevereThunderstormWarning.xml' src = open(filname, mode='r').read() cap = NWSCAPParser(src) for ID, entry in cap.entries.items(): print('ID=', ID, ', entry=', entry)`
        
        You can also pass a url to NWSCAPParser() `python from nwscapparser3 import NWSCAPParser cap = NWSCAPParser('http://alerts.weather.gov/cap/nc.php?x=1') for ID, entry in cap.entries.items(): print('ID=', ID, ', entry=', entry) # you can access attributes of the event print('entry.status=', entry.status) print('entry.msgType=', entry.msgType)`
        
        ### us_states
        
        The module also exports a dictionary us_states with keys that are two-letter US state abbreviations and values that are full state names, to aid in iterating through the feeds offered by the NWS, which are published by state abbreviations. For example, the CAP feed for Arizona (AZ) can be accessed at the URL http://alerts.weather.gov/cap/az.php?x=1.
