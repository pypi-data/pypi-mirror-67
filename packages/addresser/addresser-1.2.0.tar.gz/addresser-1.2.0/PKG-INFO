Description: Addresser
        =========
        
        Addresser parses and normalizes street addresses and intersections. It is a port of the Node package,
        `parse-address <https://github.com/hassansin/parse-address>`_, which in turn is a port of the PERL package,
        `Geo::StreetAddress::US <http://search.cpan.org/~timb/Geo-StreetAddress-US-1.04/US.pm>`_.
        
        From the `Geo::StreetAddress::US` description:
        
            Geo::StreetAddress::US is a regex-based street address and street intersection parser for the United States. Its
            basic goal is to be as forgiving as possible when parsing user-provided address strings. Geo::StreetAddress::US knows
            about directional prefixes and suffixes, fractional building numbers, building units, grid-based addresses (such as
            those used in parts of Utah), 5 and 9 digit ZIP codes, and all of the official USPS abbreviations for street types
            and state names...

        **Result**
