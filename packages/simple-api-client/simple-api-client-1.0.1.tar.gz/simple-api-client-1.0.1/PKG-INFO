        Install and update using `pipenv`
        
        ```bash

        from logging import Logger
        
        
        logger = Logger("simple-logger", level="DEBUG")
        client = ApiClient("http://www.example.com", logger)
        
        response = client.get("/example/endpoint")
        
        if response.status_code == 200:
            print(response.data)
        ```
        
        ## Development
        
        __The build pipeline require your tests to pass and code to be formatted__
        
        Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine (use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)).
        
        Install the dependencies with [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) (making sure to include dev and pre-release packages):
        
        ```bash
        pipenv install --dev --pre
        ```
        
        Configure your environment:
        
        ```bash
        pipenv shell && export PYTHONPATH="$PWD"
        ```
        
        Run the tests:
        
        ```bash
        pytest
        ```
        
        Or with logging:
        
        ```bash
        pytest -s
        ```
        
        Or tests with coverage:
        
        ```bash
        pytest --cov=./
        ```
        
        Format the code with [Black](https://github.com/psf/black):
        
        ```bash
        black $PWD
        ```
        
        ## Releases
        
        Cleanup the (.gitignored) `dist` folder (if you have one):
        
        ```bash
        rm -rf dist
        ```
        
        Notch up the version number in `setup.py` and build:
        
        ```bash
        python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
        ```
        
        Push to PyPi (using the ScholarPack credentials when prompted)
        
        ```bash
        python3 -m twine upload --repository-url https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
        ```
