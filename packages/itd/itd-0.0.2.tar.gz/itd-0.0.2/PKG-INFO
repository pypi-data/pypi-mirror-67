Description: # itd - In The Dark
        
        An Adventure / Escape Game for python programers.
        
        # Recomandation for the best experience
        
        You can do whatever you want to solve the game. But some strategies would lead to a lesser interesting experience.
        
        We recommand to:
        - Have autocompletion in your REPL (just pip install readline, or pyreadline if you dont)
        - Not read the `itd` package code. All answers are there.
        - Avoid inspecting any object named `ITD_*` and any attibutes names `_ITD_*`.
        - Do not reload the `itd` package, it would reset your progression.
        
        # Security Concern
        
        You may wory about what the game is alowed to do, like format your drive or access and use sensible information.
        But that is true for any game you install...
        
        You can solve those concerns by inspecting the code, but that would ruin the experience for you.
        
        You may however run the code inside a contained env like a docker or alike...
        
        Note that this first episode of `In The Dark` does not require an internet connection.
        
        # Usage
        
        install `itd` in a virtual env:
        ```
        $ python -m venv ITD.venv
        $ souce .\ITD.venv\bin\activate
        (ITD.venv) $ pip install itd
        ```
        
        If you don't have completion on your python REPL, install one.
        
        You should try readline first: `pip install readline`
        
        It will fail with a red warning in some case (i.e. on Windows). In this case you can 
        install pyreadline: `pip install pyreadline`
        
        
        Run the python REPL and import itd, enjoy
        ```
        (ITD.venv) $ python
        Python 3.7.0 ...
        Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
        >>> import itd
        ```
