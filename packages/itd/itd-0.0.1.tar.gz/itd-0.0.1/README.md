# itd - In The Dark

An Adventure / Escape Game for python programers.

# Recomandation for the best experience

You can do whatever you want to solve the game. But some strategies would lead to a lesser interestin experience.

We recommand to:
- Not read the `itd` code. All answers are there.
- Avoid inspecting any object named `ITD_*`

# Security Concern

You may wory about what the game is alowed to do, like format your drive or access and use sensible information.
But that is true for any game you install...

You can solve those concerns by inspecting the code, but that would ruin the experience for you.

You may however run the code inside a contained env like a docker or alike...

Note that this first episode of `In The Dark` does not require an internet connection.

# Usage

install `itd` in a virtual env:
```
$ python -m venv ITD.venv
$ souce .\ITD.venv\bin\activate
$ pip install itd
```

Run the python REPL and import itd, enjoy
```
