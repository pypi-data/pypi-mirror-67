        ## Generate your Palo Alto firewall API key
        See [Palo Alto Networks documentation](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-0/pan-os-panorama-api/get-started-with-the-pan-os-xml-api/get-your-api-key.html) on generating your API key.
        
        ## Constraints
        * Only one nesting for address groups
        * Does not include "any" rules based on zones (as we can't tell the zone from the object name)
        * Does not match with subnet rules (you can have a rule saying 10.0.0.0/8 is allowed, but your object with the address 10.1.1.1 is not listed)
        * Does currently not support other rule types than security rules (no NAT/Decryption/etc)
