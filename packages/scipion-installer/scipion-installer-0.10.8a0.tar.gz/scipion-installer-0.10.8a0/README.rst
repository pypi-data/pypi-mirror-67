Troubleshooting
===============

Pip is needed to get the installer. For ubuntu/debian you might need root access to run 

    sudo apt-get install python-pip

No root access?: You can try *pip install --user scipion-installer* to install it localy

Missing dependencies: scipion needs python3-tkinter to work and an existing python3 installation.
For ubuntu/debian you might need root access to run 

    sudo apt-get install python3-tk
    
If *Error: â€œpkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: The 'zipp>=0.5'* is raised when launching installscipion, try to install zipp by

    pip install zipp
