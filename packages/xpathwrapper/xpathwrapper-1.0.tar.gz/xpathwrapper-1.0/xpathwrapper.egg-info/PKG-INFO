            Locating by XPath; XPath is the language used for locating nodes in an XML document. As HTML can 
            be an implementation of XML (XHTML), Selenium users can leverage this powerful language to target 
            elements in their web applications. XPath extends beyond (as well as supporting) the simple methods 
            of locating by id or name attributes, and opens up all sorts of new possibilities such as locating 
            the third checkbox on the page.
        
            One of the main reasons for using XPath is when you don't have a suitable id or name attribute for 
            the element you wish to locate. You can use XPath to either locate the element in absolute terms 
            (not advised), or relative to an element that does have an id or name attribute. XPath locators can 
            also be used to specify elements via attributes other than id and name.
        
            Absolute XPaths contain the location of all elements from the root (html) and as a result are likely 
            to fail with only the slightest adjustment to the application. By finding a nearby element with an id 
            or name attribute (ideally a parent element) you can locate your target element based on the 
            relationship. This is much less likely to change and can make your tests more robust.

            returned. If no element has a matching link text attribute, a NoSuchElementException will be raised.
