Description: A library which implements the main variants of Stochastic Diffusion
        Search (SDS), and provides a convenient front end.
        
        Stochastic Diffusion Search (SDS) is a generic population-based search method.
        SDS agents perform cheap, partial evaluations of a hypothesis (a candidate
        solution to the search problem). Hypotheses with the potential to be strong
        solutions are then diffused through the swarm through direct one-to-one
        communication. As a result of the diffusion mechanism, high-quality solutions
        can be identified from clusters of agents with the same hypothesis.
        
        This is a library used during the writing of my PhD thesis, full documentation
        and code are both published online.
        
        SDS has a Scholarpedia page:

        A list of papers written on SDS can be found in the Stochastic Diffusion
        Search paper repository, maintained by the author of this module:
