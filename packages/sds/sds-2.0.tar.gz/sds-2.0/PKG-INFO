Description: A library which implements the main variants of Stochastic Diffusion
        Search (SDS), and provides a convenient front end.
        
        Stochastic Diffusion Search (SDS) is a generic population-based search
        method. SDS agents perform cheap, partial evaluations of a hypothesis (a
        candidate solution to the search problem). They then share information
        about hypotheses (diffusion of information) through direct one-to-one
        communication. As a result of the diffusion mechanism, high-quality
        solutions can be identified from clusters of agents with the same
        hypothesis.
        
        This is a library used during the writing of my PhD thesis, I will
        publish full documentation and host the code on GitHub once the design
        has settled down and I have submitted my thesis. Until then, feel free
        to email me.
        
        SDS has a Scholarpedia page:

        A list of papers written on SDS can be found in the Stochastic Diffusion
        Search paper repository, maintained by the author of this module:
