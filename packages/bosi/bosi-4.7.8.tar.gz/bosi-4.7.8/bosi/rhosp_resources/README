This directory contains artifacts required for building tarballs
for RHOSP. Contents of this directory are not used by BOSI in any
way.

Placeholder for RHOSP resources.

Resources are grouped based on Openstack release branches.
Typically all branch directories are symlinks to 'master' directory.
Unless there is change for a particular branch, in which case it will
be an actual directory containing the script/yaml files.

When making a fix in master that should be propogated to all the other
releases, please check branch specific directory to make sure it is
updated.
