CKAN 2.8 Pytest Plugin and Fixtures
===================================
This project backports the `pytest` environment for CKAN from CKAN 2.9 to CKAN
2.8. This allows CKAN extension developers to test CKAN plugins built to 
work with CKAN 2.8 as well as CKAN 2.9 or newer using a single unified test
suite. 

Installation & Usage
--------------------
To use this in your project:

 * Add this library to your CKAN plugin project
 * Write your tests with pytest (you can use CKAN fixtures as described below)
 * Run `pytest`
 * When tested with CKAN 2.9 or newer, CKAN's built-in pytest plugin and fixtures 
   will be used
 * When tested with older versions of CKAN, the code in `pytest_ckan` will
   be used instead

### Adding to CKAN project

To use this plugin to test your CKAN extension, simply install this library to
your development / testing environment:

    pip install pytest-ckan

If you maintain a `dev-requirements.txt` or `test-requirements.txt` file you 
can add this library to it. 

### Running Pytest
To enable CKAN testing, simply add `--ckan-ini=<path/to/test.ini>` to your 
`pytest` command, for example:

```bash
pytest --ckan-ini=test.ini ckanext/yourextension/tests
```

### Using CKAN Fixtures and Markers in Tests

TBD; 

For now, see 
[CKAN 2.9's extension testing guide](https://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/extensions/testing-extensions.html)
for some examples.
