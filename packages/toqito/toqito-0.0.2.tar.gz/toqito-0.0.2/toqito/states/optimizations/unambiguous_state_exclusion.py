    Compute probability of unambiguous state exclusion [BJOP14]_.

    This function implements the following semidefinite program that provides
    the optimal probability with which Bob can conduct quantum state exclusion.

    .. math::

        \begin{align*}
            \text{maximize:} \quad & \sum_{i=0}^n \sum_{j=0}^n
                                     \langle M_i, \rho_j \rangle \\
            \text{subject to:} \quad & \sum_{i=0}^n M_i \leq \mathbb{I},\\
                                     & \text{Tr}(\rho_i M_i) = 0,
                                       \quad \quad \forall 1  \leq i \leq n, \\
                                     & M_0, \ldots, M_n \geq 0
        \end{align*}

    Examples
    ==========

    Consider the following two Bell states

    .. math::
        u_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |00 \rangle + |11 \rangle \right) \\
        u_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |00 \rangle - |11 \rangle \right).

    For the corresponding density matrices :math:`\rho_0 = u_0 u_0^*` and
    :math:`\rho_1 = u_1 u_1^*`, we may construct a set

    .. math::
        \rho = \{\rho_0, \rho_1 \}

    such that

    .. math::
        p = \{1/2, 1/2\}.

    It is not possible to unambiguously exclude either of the two states. We can
    see that the result of the function in `toqito` yields a value of :math:`0`
    as the probability for this to occur.
