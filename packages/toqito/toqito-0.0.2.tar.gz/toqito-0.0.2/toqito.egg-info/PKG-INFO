Description: # ToQITo (Theory of Quantum Information Toolkit)
        
        The `toqito` package is a Python package for studying various aspects of
        quantum information theory. Specifically, `toqito` focuses on providing
        numerical tools to study problems pertaining to entanglement theory, nonlocal
        games, matrix analysis, and other aspects of quantum information that are often
        associated with computer science.

        `toqito` aims to fill the needs of quantum information researchers who want
        numerical and computational tools for manipulating quantum states,
        measurements, and channels. It can also be used as a tool to enhance the
        experience of students and instructors in classes pertaining to quantum
        information. 
        
        The inspiration for this package is heavily influenced by the
        [QETLAB](http://www.qetlab.com) package in MATLAB by Nathaniel Johnston.  Many
        of the functions found here are direct ports of those functions converted into
        Python code.
        
        ## Installing
        
        The preferred way to install the `toqito` package is via `pip`:
        
        ```
        pip install toqito
        ```
        
        Alternatively, to install, you may also run the following command from the
        top-level package directory.
        
        ```
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        ## Using
        
        The documentation for `toqito`, along with specific examples of usage are
        provided on the 
        [documentation page](https://toqito.readthedocs.io/en/latest/toqito.html).
        
        ## Testing
        
        The `nose` module is used for testing. To run the suite of tests for `toqito`,
        run the following command in the root directory of this project.
        
            nosetests --with-coverage --cover-erase --cover-package toqito
