"""
Implements the "hardware" for tracing a function.

Will perform the instructions and updates CPU registers, stack information, etc.

WARNING:
    Do NOT rely on the flags registers being correct.  There are places were flags are NOT being updated when they
    should, and the very fact that CALL instructions are skipped could cause flags to be incorrect.

    we are blindly taking every branch to ensure we get all possible data at any given address.  It turns out
    we need to know the target of the Jcc instruction for the condition as emulated
    (condition_target_ea).  We also need to know the value of the branch we would NOT have taken (at least as
    best of a guess as we can make in some cases) and where that value would have been set.  In order to
    calculate the value, we need to know what kind of test instruction was used, so that mnem is tracked as well.When
