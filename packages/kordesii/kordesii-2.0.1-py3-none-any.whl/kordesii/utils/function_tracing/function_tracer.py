"""
Function tracing utility which will trace a function to a given EA and provide the value stored in a given operand.idaapi.__struct_unpack_table

This will essentially emulate, on a very primitive level, a x86(_64) cpu during execution and will maintain the stack,
registers, etc.

class FunctionTracer(object):
    """
    This class should be instantiated by the user in order to trace a function.  Ideally, the object will be stored
    for future use should the caller expect the function traced to be analyzed multiple times.

    To use, the caller will supply the function address (or any address within the function), the address where the
    value of interest is set, the operand containing the value of interest, and optionally a list of arguments passed
    to the function.  The list of arguments will be used to set argument values for a more complete assessment of the
    function.

    The FunctionTracer object will utilize the IDAPython FlowChart object, with custom BasicBlocks.  The FlowChart
    object is utilized to efficiently grab all the instructions which are known to be executed sequentially, as well
    as ensure that the function is traced using appropriate code paths to the interesting ea.  A "snapshot" of the
    CPU register state and stack will be copied and stored for each custom BasicBlock.  The idea behind storing this
    "snapshot" is that if the function needs to be traced multiple times, the "snapshot" data can be utilized to
    initialize the state of execution when a previously unanalyzed block is being inspected rather than having to
    completely reanalyze the entire function again.
