Description: # ofxstatement-french
        
        This project provides custom
        [ofxstatement](https://github.com/kedder/ofxstatement) plugin(s) for these french
        financial institutions:
        - BanquePopulaire, France, PDF (https://www.banquepopulaire.fr/)
        
        `ofxstatement` is a tool to convert a proprietary bank statement to OFX
        format, suitable for importing into programs like GnuCash or Beancount. The
        plugin for ofxstatement parses the bank statement and produces a common data
        structure, that is then formatted into an OFX file.
        
        The PDF is converted using the
        [pdftotext](https://pypi.org/project/pdftotext/) utility.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### Preconditions
        
        You have to install the poppler library first, see
        [pdftotext](https://pypi.org/project/pdftotext/)
        
        ### Using pip
        
        ```
        $ pip install ofxstatement-french
        ```
        
        ### Development version from source
        
        ```
        $ git clone https://github.com/gpaulissen/ofxstatement-french.git
        $ pip install -e .
        ```
        
        ### Troubleshooting
        
        This package depends on ofxstatement with a version at least 0.6.5. This
        version may not yet be available in PyPI so install that from source like
        this:
        ```
        $ git clone https://github.com/gpaulissen/ofxstatement.git
        $ pip install -e .
        ```
        
        ## Test
        
        To run the tests from the development version you can use the py.test command:
        
        ```
        $ py.test
        ```
        
        You may need to install the required test packages first:
        
        ```
        $ pip install -r test_requirements.txt
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### Show installed plugins
        
        This shows the all installed plugins, not only those from this package:
        
        ```
        $ ofxstatement list-plugins
        ```
        
        You should see at least:
        
        ```
        The following plugins are available:
        
          ...
          fr-banquepopulaire BanquePopulaire, France, PDF (https://www.banquepopulaire.fr/)
          ...
        
        ```
        
        ### Convert
        
        Use something like this:
        
        ```
        $ ofxstatement convert -t fr-banquepopulaire <file>.pdf <file>.ofx
        ```
        
        Or you can convert the PDF yourself and supply the text as input:
        
        ```
        $ pdftotext -layout <file>.pdf <file>.txt
        $ ofxstatement convert -t fr-banquepopulaire <file>.txt <file>.ofx
        ```
        
        See also the section configuration below.
        
        ### Configuration
        
        For BanquePopulaire you may download their OFX files and use them to provide
        you with their OFX FITID numbers instead of relying on FITID numbers generated
        by the ofxstatement tool. You can specifiy the OFX files to read first using
        the ofxstatement configuration. The OFX files configuration is a file wildcard
        relative to the PDF to convert.
        
        ```
        $ ofxstatement edit-config
        ```
        
        This is a sample configuration (do not forget to specify the plugin for each section):
        
        ```
        [banquepopulaire]
        plugin = fr-banquepopulaire
        ofx_files = *.ofx
        ```
        
        Now this statement will convert <file>.pdf downloaded from BanquePopulaire
        (Mon Espace -> Mes documents Ã©lectroniques -> Comptes) to <file>.ofx while
        using the FITIDs found in the *.ofx files in the directory of <file>.pdf.
        
        ```
        $ ofxstatement convert -t banquepopulaire <file>.pdf <file>.ofx
        ```

        ### Changed
        
        	- Added the ability to retrieve the OFX id (FITID) from OFX files
        	downloaded from BanquePopulaire instead of using an id generated

        ## [1.1.1] - 2020-03-23
        
        ### Changed
        
        	- The generation af a unique OFX id did only return a counter in
        	case of duplicates
        	- The Readme mentions now my fork of the ofxstatement instead of
        	https://github.com/kedder/ofxstatement.git
        	- The __about__.py file outputs the version number and that is
        	used in the Makefile
        	- The Makefile depends now on GNU make for tagging a release
        
        ## [1.1.0] - 2020-03-22
        
        ### Added

        	- The Readme mentions test_requirements.txt for installing test modules
        	- More checks concerning the content (dates with start and end

        	- Casden accounts also supported
        	- Negative balances recognized
        	- Added Makefile for keeping the important operations together

        	- Handling of 29 february improved
        	- Improved handling of graphics in the PDF which transforms to a
        	description starting with F and whitespace.
        	- The BIC is also recognized if the line does not end with a BIC
        	followed by only whitespace (hence BIC<ws><number><ws><.+> is now
        	allowed)
        	- Better determination of the statement header.
        
        ## [1.0.0] - 2020-03-16
