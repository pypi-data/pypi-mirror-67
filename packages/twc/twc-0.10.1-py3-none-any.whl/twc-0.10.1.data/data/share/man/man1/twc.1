.SH "NAME"
TWC \- TaskWarrior Controller \- interactive command\-line task and todo manager.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBtwc\fP [\fIOPTIONS\fP]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
TWC is an interactive command\-line task and todo manager which acts as a
frontend for a popular program TaskWarrior. It eases and speeds up the burden
of managing lists of tasks and offers many features which are expected from
modern task and todo managers.
.sp
TWC can be invoked with additional arguments which modify its initial state and
behavior. The following options are available:
.sp
\fB\-a, \-\-agenda\fP=\fIAGENDA\fP
.RS 4
Selects agenda which should be initially displayed when TWC starts. This option
exects full agenda name and is case\-sensitive. If agenda\(cqs name contains spaces
or other special characters, it can be e.g. enclosed in single or double quotes
(see your shell manual for informations about escaping special characters:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
twc \-\-agenda="Next tasks"
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
Setting this option overrides \fIagenda\fP setting from
configuration file.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-t, \-\-taskrc\fP=\fITASKRC\fP
.RS 4
Path to taskrc which should be the source of TaskWarrior configuration used by
TWC. This file should contain for example configuration of taskd
(synchronization server) or UDAs. By default \fI~/.taskrc\fP is used. See also
\fBtaskrc(5)\fP.
.sp
Setting this option overrides \fItaskrc\fP setting from
configuration file.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-debug\fP
.RS 4
Enables additional features useful for debugging, like printing full tracebacks
for exceptions.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-version\fP
.RS 4
Shows TWC\(cqs version number and then exits.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-h, \-\-help\fP
.RS 4
Displays a help message with short summary of available options and then exits.
.RE
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.sp
During startup TWC reads a configuration file that commonly contains various
settings: definitions of agendas, key bindings, program options etc. Typically
it is kept in user\(cqs configuration directory: \fI~/.config/twc/config.py\fP, but
TWC follows ther rules of \c
.URL "https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir\-spec/basedir\-spec\-latest.html" "XDG Base Directory Specification" ":"
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP " 1." 4.2
.\}
\fI$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/twc/config.py\fP is checked. If \f(CR$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\fP is not
set, it defaults to \fI$HOME/.config\fP.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP " 2." 4.2
.\}
any of \fI$XDG_DATA_DIRS/twc/config.py\fP is checked. \f(CR$XDG_DATA_DIRS\fP is a
colon\-separated list of directories to check. If it is not set, it defaults
to a single directory: /etc/xdg.
.RE
.sp
Some options can be configured with specific program arguments. They are
usually named the same as their config.py counterparts and they take precedence
over settings from configuration file.
.sp
TWC\(cqs configuration file is ordinary Python file. It comes with exposed
\fBvariable c\fP which should be used to configure all aspects of TWC and it
contains all necessary methods to do so.
.SS "Agendas"
.sp
Agendas are built from blocks. Each block specifies methods of retrieving tasks
from TaskWarrior and presenting them in TWC. These include, but are not limited
to filter used to retrieve tasks, tasks\(aq sorting method and tasks formatting.
.sp
Agendas are automatically created when blocks are defined. This is all done
with \fBc.add_block()\fP function, which requires specifying parent agenda of block.
.sp
Apart from \fIagenda\fP, all parameters passed to \fBc.add_block()\fP must be named,
i.e.  given in form of \fIname=value\fP, like: \fIsort=\(aqurgency\(aq\fP, \fIlimit=5\fP etc.
.SS "Formatting"
.sp
Block\(cqs \f(CRitems\fP and \f(CRstatusleft\fP and \f(CRstatusright\fP parameters are composed of
lists of displayed items; they can be separated by comma, which produces space
between items, or by "+" sign, which concatenates items to each other without
leaving space between them.
.sp
Each item can optionally be followed by a name of style which will be applied
to it and item\-specific string formatting. When style of formatting are added,
they should be separated and ended by a colon ":".
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
formatting = \(aqitem_name:style:item_fmt:\(aq
many_items = \(aqitem1,item2+item3

.br
.ps +1
.B Note
.ps -1
.br
.sp
Terminating style and string formatting with a colon is not strictly necessary,
however it is advised. If terminating colon is missing, TWC will try to
intelligently detect style and format definitions, but it can fail in some
cases and misinterpret parts of item\(cqs surrounding text as a style name or
string formatting. If that happens, just throw a colon to explicitly indicate
where they end.
.sp .5v
.RE
.sp
Items are displayed only when they are present (not empty). For example if
there are no tags defined for a specific task, \f(CRtags\fP item will not produce any
output.
.sp
Items might contain additional characters in place of their names. TWC
recognizes item name in this case. These characters are not independent however:
they will also be printed only when item is present. They can be used e.g.
to visually delimit some items from the others (e.g. by surrounding tags with
braces).
.sp
You can use any TaskWarrior\(cqs attribute name (including UDAs).
.sp
Some examples:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
items = \(aq[priority:warning:],due:info:%Y\-%m\-%d:,description,id:comment:\(aq
items = \(aqid+[flags::%a],description:info,customuda:comment\(aq

.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
.ps +1

.sp
For some types TWC returns pre\-formatted strings. For example, all lists (like
list of tags or annotations) will have their elements separated by a colon.

.SS "Key Bindings"
.sp
You can modify any key binding available in TWC with two functions: \fBc.bind()\fP
and \fBc.unbind()\fP. Unbinding is particularily useful if you want to disable a
default key, because TWC will unbind automatically keys when re\-binding them to
a different command.
.sp
TWC supports key sequences: executing commands by pressing some keys following
the others (similar to e.g. Vim). For example, to jump to the first task in
agenda you can double press "g". In configuration this should be set as \fIg g\fP
(2 "g" letters separated by space).
.sp
Key prefixes are supported:

.RE
.sp
Due to how most terminals work, when you want to bind a command to
"shift+letter", you\(cqll usually simply write upper\-case letter, like A
instead of Shift\0+\0a.
.sp
There are 2 sets of default key bindings enabled: ordinary ones (arrows used
for navigation, used shortcuts are common in most of popular applications like
text editors) and Vim\-style (bindings familiar to Vim users).

\fBc.add_block(agenda, *, title, items=\(aqdescription\(aq, filter=None, sort=None, limit=None)\fP
.RS 4
Adds a new block to a given \fIagenda\fP, which will be created if it doesn\(cqt exist.
.sp
Block contains a \fItitle\fP which is displayed above all of its tasks. Block
titles are automatically styled with \f(CRheading\fP style.
.RE
.sp
Task formatting is described by \fIitems\fP string (see Formatting section for
details). By default only raw task description is displayed.
.sp

When given, \fIsort\fP parameter decides order of tasks inside block.  It is
compatible with TaskWarrior\(cqs reports sorting. It iss defined by a
comma\-separated list of task attributes. Each of attributes can be additionally
post\-fixed by a "+" or "\-" sign for ascending and descending order. For
example:
.sp
+
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
sort=\(aqproject+,urgency\-,priority\(aq
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
+
TaskWarrior\(cqs listing breaks (e.g. \f(CRproject+/,description+\fP) are not supported.
.sp
+
Maximum number of tasks displayed in block can be limited by a \fIlimit\fP. This
is applied after sorting. By default number of tasks is not limited.
.sp
