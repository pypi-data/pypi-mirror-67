== Termux

TWC works on {termux}[Termux], although there's currently a {tzlocal-bug}[bug]
in tzlocal - a library indirectly used by TWC to get local timezone
information.

Before running TWC on Termux you have to export the following environment
variable:

[source,sh]
----
export TZ=$(getprop persist.sys.timezone)
----

Termux emulates scroll events as key presses. You can bind them for easier
navigation:

[source,python]
----
c.bind('right', 'next-agenda')
c.bind('left', 'prev-agenda')
----

=== Opening Links in a Browser

To make _<<settings-followurl,followurl>>_ command work, you have to export the
following environment variable:

[source,sh]
----
export BROWSER=termux-open-url
----
