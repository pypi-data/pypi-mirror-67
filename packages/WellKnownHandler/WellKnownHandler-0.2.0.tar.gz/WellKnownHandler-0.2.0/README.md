## About The Project

Auxiliary Python3 library that allows for simple parsing and usage of an SSO server's "well-known" endpoints.
This library is created to support EOEPCA's project, but is generic enough to be used in any other environment.

Currently supported endpoints (easily expandable!):
  - OIDC
  - SCIM

### Built With

- [Python](https://www.python.org//)
- [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org)

- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/)

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org//)
- [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

### Installation

Just download the library using pip
