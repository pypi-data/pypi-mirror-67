        Small python module for reading /var/lib/dhcp/dhcpd.leases from
        isc-dhcp-server. This module works in Python 2.7 and 3.x
        
        This module also supports reading lease files from the isc dhcp daemon
        running in IPv6 mode (Since version 0.4.0).
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Through pypi
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ sudo pip install dhcp-leases
        
        
        Through git
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ git clone git@github.com:acikogun/python-dhcp-leases.git
            $ cd python-dhcp-leases
            $ python setup.py build
            $ sudo python setup.py install
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from dhcp_leases import DhcpLeases
        
            leases = DhcpLeases('/path/to/dhcpd.leases')
            leases.get()  # Returns the leases as a list of Lease objects
            leases.get_current()  # Returns only the currently valid dhcp leases as dict
                                  # The key of the dict is the device mac address and the
                                  # Value is a Lease object
        
        Or read a gzip'ed file:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from dhcp_leases import DhcpLeases
            # DhcpLeases(filename, gzip=False)
            leases = DhcpLeases('/path/to/dhcpd.leases', True) # True param starts the gzip reader
            leases.get()  # Returns the leases as a list of Lease objects
            leases.get_current()  # Returns only the currently valid dhcp leases as dict
                                  # The key of the dict is the device mac address and the
                                  # Value is a Lease object
        
        The Lease object has the following fields (only for IPv4 leases):
        
        .. code:: python
        
            lease instanceof Lease
            lease.ip             # The ip address assigned by this lease as string
            lease.ethernet       # The mac address of the lease
            lease.hardware       # The OSI physical layer used to request the lease (usually ethernet)
            lease.start          # The start time of this lease as DateTime object
            lease.end            # The time this lease expires as DateTime object or None if this is an infinite lease
            lease.hostname       # The hostname for this lease if given by the client
            lease.binding_state  # The binding state as string ('active', 'free', 'abandoned', 'backup')
            lease.data           # Dict of all the info in the dhcpd.leases file for this lease
            lease.valid          # True if the lease hasn't expired and is not in the future
            lease.active         # True if the binding state is active
            lease.options        # List of extra options in the lease file
            lease.sets           # List of the 'set' items in the lease file
        
        
        The Lease6 object has the following fields (only for IPv6):
        
        .. code:: python
        
            lease instanceof Lease6
            lease.ip                 # The ip address assigned by this lease as string
            lease.type               # If this is a temporary or permanent address. I's one of the following:
                                     # Lease6.TEMPORARY: Temporary lease
                                     # Lease6.NON_TEMPORARY: Non-temporary lease
                                     # Lease6.PREFIX_DELEGATION: Delegated prefix lease
            lease.host_identifier    # The unique host identifier (replaces mac addresses in IPv6) as bytes
            lease.host_identifier_string # The host_identifier property formatted as an hexadecimal string
            lease.duid               # The DHCP Unique Identifier (DUID) of the host as bytes
            lease.iaid               # The Interface Association Identifier (IAID) of the host
            lease.last_communication # The last communication time with the host
            lease.end                # The time this lease expires as DateTime object or None if this is an infinite lease
            lease.binding_state      # The binding state as string ('active', 'free', 'abandoned', 'backup')
            lease.preferred_life     # The preferred lifetime in seconds
            lease.max_life           # The valid lifetime for this address in seconds
            lease.options            # List of extra options in the lease file
            lease.sets               # List of the 'set' items in the lease file
            lease.data               # Dict of all the info in the dhcpd6.leases file for this lease
        
        Unit tests
        ----------
        
        The unit tests can be run with ``setup.py``:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ python3 setup.py test
            # With coverage report:
            $ coverage run setup.py test
