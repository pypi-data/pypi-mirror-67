Description: # fold_to_ascii
        
        A Python port of the [Apache Lucene ASCII Folding
        Filter](https://lucene.apache.org/core/4_0_0/analyzers-common/org/apache/lucene/analysis/miscellaneous/ASCIIFoldingFilter.html)
        that converts alphabetic, numeric, and symbolic Unicode characters which are not
        in the first 127 ASCII characters (the "Basic Latin" Unicode block) into ASCII
        equivalents, if they exist.
        
        ## Usage
        
        ``` python
        > from fold_to_ascii import fold
        > s = u'Astroturf® paté'
        > fold(s)
        u'Astroturf pate'
        > fold(s, u'?')
        u'Astroturf? pate'
        ```
        
        ## Differences from [JS fold-to-ascii](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fold-to-ascii)
        
        This library **always** removes astral characters, even when a replacement
        character is specified. PRs welcome if you want to fix this.
        
        ## Differences from unidecode
        
        There are a few Python unidecode libraries out there
        ([1](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/text-unidecode),
        [2](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Unidecode/)). They are based on a Perl program
        that makes some interesting choices about what to replace, for example, `£`
        (`POUND SIGN`) is replaced with the string `PS`. Also, they do not allow
        specifying a replacement character to use other than the empty string for
        unmapped characters.
        
        ## Development environment
        
        ``` shell
        $ virtualenv -p python3 ~/.local/venvs/fold_to_ascii
        $ source ~/.local/venvs/fold_to_ascii/bin/activate
        $ pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        ## Test
        
        ``` shell
        $ make lint && make test
        ```
        
        ## Release
        
        Requires a [pypi](https://pypi.org/) account.
        
        1. Bump the version in setup.py.
        1. Build and upload:
        
        ``` shell
        $ python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
        $ twine upload dist/*
        ```
