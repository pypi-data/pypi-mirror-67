# crud_generator
This will generate a crud operations (crud.py) for your Database tables.

# How to Use:

# Step 1:

*   from crud_generator import generate_crud
*   generate_crud(tablename, attributes) is the function which will create crud_tablename.py file
*   Table name and attributes/column name are the only two parameters to be passed.
*   Eg: generate_crud("Employee","Name,Age,Employee_code,Salary")
*   then this will automatically create py file.

# Step 2:

*   functions created by the functions are

    #First:
*   def create_conn():
*   this function is an empty function where you can create your connections. You can choose any DB, import library accordingly.
*   Following is the code which you will get.
*   def create_conn():
*   pass
*   #Enter your connection code
*   #Example: for postgresql
*   #conn = psycopg2.connect(database = "testdb", user = "postgres", password = "pass123", host = "127.0.0.1", port = "5432")
*   #then return conn

    #Second:
*   def create_tablename(values):
*   this function will perform insert operation in table.
*   Here, you just need to pass values of the attributes
*   Eg: create_Employee("""'Alex',26,'EMP_2760',29000""") #Name,Age,Employee_code,Salary
*   You can see the sql query in CLI
*   Ensure to pass values as raw input.

    #Third:
*   def read_Employee(condition="1=1"):
*   this function will perform read operation in table.
*   Here, if you don't pass any parameters it will return all records or you can pass any condition.
*   Eg: read_Employee("Salary=2900 and Employee_code=\'EMP_2760\'") # condition similary to that in where clause can be passed here.
*   You can see the sql query in CLI

    #Fourth:
*   def update_Employee(values,condition="1=1"):
*   this function will perform update operation in table.
*   Here, if you don't pass any condition it will perform update on all records or you can pass any condition.
*   Here, you can pass values like "salary=30000", just like you pass in sql.
*   Eg: update_Employee("Salary=30000","Name=\'Alex\'") # condition similary to that in where clause can be passed here and values like     that in update statement.
*   You can see the sql query in CLI

    #Fifth:
*   def delete_Employee(condition="1=1"):
*   this function will perform delete operation in table.
*   Here, if you don't pass any parameters it will delete all records or you can pass any condition.
*   Eg: delete_Employee("Salary=2900 and Employee_code=\'EMP_2760\'") # condition similary to that in where clause can be passed here.
*   You can see the sql query in CLI
