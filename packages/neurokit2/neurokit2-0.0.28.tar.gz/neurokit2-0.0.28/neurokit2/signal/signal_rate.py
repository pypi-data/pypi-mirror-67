    """Calculate signal rate from a series of peaks.

    Parameters
    ----------
    peaks : list, array, DataFrame, Series or dict
        The samples at which thepeaks occur. If an array is
        passed, it is assumed that these containers were obtained with
        `signal_findpeaks()`. If a DataFrame is passed, it is assumed it is of the same length as
        the input signal in which occurrences of R-peaks are marked as "1", with such containers
        obtained with e.g., ecg_findpeaks() or rsp_findpeaks().
    sampling_rate : int
        The sampling frequency of the signal that contains the R-peaks (in Hz,
        i.e., samples/second). Defaults to 1000.
    desired_length : int
        By default, the returned signal rate has the same number of elements as
        the raw signal. If set to an integer, the returned signal rate will be
        interpolated between R-peaks over `desired_length` samples. Has no
        effect if a DataFrame is passed in as the `signal` argument. Defaults to
        None.

    Returns
    -------
    array
        A vector containing the rate.
