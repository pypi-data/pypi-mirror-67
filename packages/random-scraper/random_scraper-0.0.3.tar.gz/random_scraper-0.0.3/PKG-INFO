        Tools for Webscraping
        
        This package provides simple methods for scraping data anonymously and avoid getting your IP blocked by web servers. In particular, a better approach consists in using proxy servers to change IP addresses over time as well as user agents. There are both free and paid proxy servers available online. Unfortunately, the free proxies may be slow and unreliable which may result in missing data.
        
        This package automatically collects and updates available free proxies online. It also provides a list of user agents and a user-friendly tool to request a page anonymously.
