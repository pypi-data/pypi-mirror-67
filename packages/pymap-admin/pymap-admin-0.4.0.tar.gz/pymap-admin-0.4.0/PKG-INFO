Description: pymap-admin
        ===========
        
        The `pymap-admin` tool can be used to perform various admin functions against a
        running pymap server. This is a separate [grpc][2] service using [grpclib][3]
        listening on a port, typically 9090.
        
        ### `ping` Command
        
        Pings the running server and reports its version string.
        
        ```
        $ pymap-admin ping
        server_version: "0.14.1"
        ```
        
        ### `append` Command
        
        To append a message directly to a mailbox, without using IMAP, use the
        `append` admin command. First, check out the help:
        
        ```
        $ pymap-admin append --help
        ```
        
        As a basic example, you can append a message to a like this:
        
        ```
        $ cat <<EOF | pymap-admin append demouser
        > From: user@example.com
        >
        > test message!
        > EOF
        mailbox: "INBOX"
        validity: 1784302999
        uid: 101
