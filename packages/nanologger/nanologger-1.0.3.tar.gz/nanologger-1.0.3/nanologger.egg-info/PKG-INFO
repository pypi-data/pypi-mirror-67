Description: #  nanologger
        nanologger is a tiny logger made with Python.
        
        It includes basic functionality such as
        1. A basic log
        2. Warning logs
        3. Fatal logs
        4. Success logs
        
        This tiny package also includes time format editing and enabling/disabling colors
        
        ***Warning***: Windows does not support color in console, so it is automatically disabled
        
        ##  Example code:
        ```python
        import nanologger as log
        
        print("The first four logs will be printed, and will not exit on Fatal call")
        log.Log("Database service is up")
        log.Warning("File not found, using default directory")
        log.Fatal("Cannot connect to server", exit = False)
        log.Success("Operation Complete\n")
        
        print("Next three four will be printed without color")
        log.hasColor = False
        log.Log("Database service is up")
        log.Warning("File not found, using default directory")
        log.Fatal("Cannot connect to server", exit = False)
        log.Success("Operation Complete\n")
        
        print("Next three four will be printed without timestamp")
        log.hasColor = True
        log.hasTimestamp = False
        log.Log("Database service is up")
        log.Warning("File not found, using default directory")
        log.Fatal("Cannot connect to server", exit = False)
        log.Success("Operation Complete\n")
        
        print("Next three logs will be printed in a different time format, and exit on Fatal call")
        log.hasTimestamp = True
        log.hasColor = True
        log.timeFormat = "%Y-%m-%d"
        log.Log("Database service is up")
        log.Warning("File not found, using default directory")
        log.Fatal("Cannot connect to server")
        log.Success("Operation Complete")
        ```
        ##  Methods:
        1.  `Log` prints a log with a timestamp
        2.  `Warning` prints a warning with timestamp
        3.  `Fatal` prints a fatal log (terminates program if appropeiate value set)
        4.  `Success` prints a success log
        
        ##  Variables:
        1. `timeFormat` is a string, supports regular Python timestamps **default: "%d-%m-%Y %H:%M:%S"**
        2. `hasColor` is a boolean that sets/removes color from the logs **default: True**
        3. `hasTimestamp` is a boolean that sets/removes the timestamp **default: True**
