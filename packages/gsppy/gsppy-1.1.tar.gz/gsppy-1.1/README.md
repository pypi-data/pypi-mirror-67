## Requirements

Install Python:

```console
sudo apt install python3
```

## Installation
To download GSP-Py just clone the Git repository hosted in GitHub:

```console
git clone https://github.com/jacksonpradolima/gsp-py.git
python setup.py install
```

Alternatively, you can install it with `pip`:

```console
pip install gsppy
```

## Usage
Examples of configuring and running are located in the *test* folders [gsppy folder](gsppy).

To use it in a project, import it and use the GSP class.

```console
from gsppy.gsp import GSP
```

It is assumed that your transactions are a sequence of sequences representing items in baskets. 

```console
 transactions = [
            ['Bread', 'Milk'],
            ['Bread', 'Diaper', 'Beer', 'Eggs'],
            ['Milk', 'Diaper', 'Beer', 'Coke'],
            ['Bread', 'Milk', 'Diaper', 'Beer'],
            ['Bread', 'Milk', 'Diaper', 'Coke']
        ]
```

Init the class to prepare the transactions and to find patterns in baskets that occur over the support threshold (count):

```console
result = GSP(transactions).search(0.3)
```

The support count (or simply support) for a sequence is defined as the fraction of total data-sequences that "contain" this sequence.
(Although the word "contains" is not strictly accurate once we incorporate taxonomies, it captures the spirt of when a data-sequence contributes to the support of a sequential pattern.)
