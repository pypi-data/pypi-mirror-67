Introduction
==================


Jinjamator is an automation framework built to make complex automation tasks as easy and boilerplate free as possible.

Features
-----------------

Jinjamator currently has following features:
    * run tasks written in python3
    * run tasks written in jinja2
    * register functions via content plugin system for python3 and jinja2 tasks, to have the same functionality.
    * run standalone as CLI application
    * run as REST API daemon, exporting tasks via REST API
    * gathering of required user inputs, determined by code inspection
    * validation of user inputs
    * log everthing to a database (daemon mode only, CLI is on roadmap)
    * support of different (customer) environments
    * distributed operation (daemon mode only)
    * output plugin system to further process data generated by tasks (e.g.: generate excel files from everthing)
    * includes a simple single-page javascript webapp for running tasks (automatically generates wizards from the task code)



Content Plugins
-----------------

* cisco.aci (query apic)
* ssh (run commands via ssh)
* fsm (parse ssh outputs to objects via textfsm)
* log

Many more to come.


Output Plugins
-----------------

* console (print data to stdout)
* excel (create a xlsx from task data)
* apic (push data to cisco ACI)
* null (supress output)

Many more to come.

Installation

Install jinjamator by running:

    pip3 install jinjamator
