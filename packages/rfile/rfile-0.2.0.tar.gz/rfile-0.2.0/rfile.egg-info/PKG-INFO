Description: # rfile
        
        [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/rfile.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/rfile)
        
        ## Overview
        
        `rfile` generates an `Rfile` to make your R package set reproducable, similar to
        how `Gemfile` and `Brewfile` work.
        
        ## Installing `rfile`
        
        `pip install rfile`
        
        ## Backstory
        
        I'm not in the trenches every day with R, sometimes taking breaks of months at a
        time from the language. When I arrive back, I'm often looking at previous code,
        and trying to get back up to speed as quickly as possible. If I've updated all
        of my package via `brew` in the interim, I'm going to have a bad time with
        missing packages. Having an `Rfile` that knows about all the packages that I
        previously had installed enables a quick recovery, and gets me back to stumbling
        my way through the `tidyverse` again!
        
        ## Current Functionality
        
        Currently, only reading and writing from the current directory is supported. The
        default mirror for CRAN is `http://cran.us.r-project.org`, which can be changed
        by specifying `-m/--mirror`.
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```none
        rfile -h
        usage: rfile [-h] [-m MIRROR]
        
        Generate an Rfile for your packages
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -m MIRROR, --mirror MIRROR
                                Enter a mirror to use for CRAN (default:
                                http://cran.us.r-project.org)
        ```
        
        ### Generate an `Rfile`
        
        `rfile` will create an `Rfile` with a list of installed packages in the currnet
        working directory. This will cover both CRAN and Github packages. You can then
        include this file in something similar to a "dotfiles" repository for easy
        portability.
        
        ### Install packages from an `Rfile`
        
        Run `rfile` in the same directory as the `Rfile`. That's it.
