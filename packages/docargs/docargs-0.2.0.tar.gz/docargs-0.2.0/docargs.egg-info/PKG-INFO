Description: # docargs
        
        A package to check that you have documented all your parameters.
        
        Docargs is written with continuous integration in mind: It will raise an error
        if you have not documented all your function arguments. It's easy to forget, but
        it's also important not to - so you should automate a test of it!
        
        To use, simply `pip install docargs`, and run `docargs mypackage/**/*py`. Alternatively, docargs integrates with flake8, so running `flake8 mypackage` will also work.
        
        To see it in action, check out the travis CI configuration
        on this [repository](https://travis-ci.org/janfreyberg/docargs)
        
        Currently, `docargs` only works with `numpydoc`-style docstrings.
