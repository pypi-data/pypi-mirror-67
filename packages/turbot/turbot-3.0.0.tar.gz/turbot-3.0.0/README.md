A Discord bot for everything _Animal Crossing: New Horizons_.

## ü§ñ Running the bot

First install `turbot` using [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):

```shell
pip install turbot
```

Then you must configure two things:

1. Your Discord bot token.
2. The list of channels you want `turbot` to monitor.

To provide your Discord bot token either set an environment variable named
`TURBOT_TOKEN` to the token or paste it into a file named `token.txt`.

For the list of channels you can provide channel names on the command line using
any number of `--channel "name"` options. Alternatively you can create a file
named `channels.txt` where each line of the file is a channel name.

More usage help can be found by running `turbot --help`.

## üì± Using the bot

Once you've connected the bot to your server, you can interact with it over
Discord via the following commands in any of the authorized channels.

- `!help` - Provides detailed help about all of the following commands.

### ü§î User Preferences

These commands allow users to set their preferences. These preferences are used
to make other commands more relevant, for example by converting times to the
user's preferred timezone.

- `!hemisphere`
- `!timezone`

### üí∏ Turnips

These commands help users buy low and sell high in the stalk market.

- `!bestsell`
- `!buy`
- `!clear`
- `!graph`
- `!history`
- `!lastweek`
- `!oops`
- `!predict`
- `!reset`
- `!sell`
- `!turnippattern`

### üêü Fish and Bugs

Provides users with information on where and when to catch critters.

- `!bugs`
- `!fish`
- `!new`

### ü¶¥ Fossils & üñºÔ∏è Art

When a community of users tracks collectables and trades them between each
other, everyone finishes collecting everything in the game s much more quickly
than they would on their own.

These commands can also help users tell fake art from real art.

- `!allart`
- `!allfossils`
- `!art`
- `!collect`
- `!collected`
- `!count`
- `!neededfossils`
- `!search`
- `!uncollect`
- `!uncollected`
