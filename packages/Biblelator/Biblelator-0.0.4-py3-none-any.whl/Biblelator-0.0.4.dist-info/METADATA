A USFM Bible editor using the [BibleOrgSys](https://pypi.org/project/BibleOrgSys/)
library and Python's tKinter windowing library for simple and easy installation.
(It's all in the standard CPython install.)

The app can be run from the command line with:
    `Biblelator`
or to view all the available options:
    `Biblelator --help`
You can discover the version with:
    `Biblelator --version`

Biblelator reads or creates a `BiblelatorData` folder in your home folder.
Log files are stored in a subfolder there and may be useful for reporting errors.
(If you have start-up problems, you might want to edit the settings there,
or even delete the entire settings file if you have no saved windows settings yet.)

The other auxilliary apps included are `BiblelatorSettingsEditor`,
`BOSManager` (for inspecting Bible organisational systems), and
`SwordManager` for viewing
and downloading [Sword](https://crosswire.org/sword/index.jsp) modules.
(All are at various stages of incompleteness.)

NOTE: This packaging is still being tested following massive restructuring,
and is not necessarily fully functional until it is marked as v0.1.0 or higher
when some open-licensed resources will also be downloadable.
We also have hopes to improve documentation before v0.2.0.

After that point, we also hope to release Docker and Snap versions.

This software has been developed in small chunks of spare time since 2013
(so it's not necessarily well-thought out, and definitely not polished).
However, it was used as my main Bible editor instead of Paratext
for a couple of years.

This package will not reach v1.0.0 until after the BibleOrgSys reaches it.

The API will not become fixed/stable until the v1.0.0 release.

No attempt at all has been made at memory or speed optimisations
and this is not planned until after the release of v1.0.0.

Biblelator is developed and tested on Linux (Ubuntu) but should also run on Windows (although not so well tested).
