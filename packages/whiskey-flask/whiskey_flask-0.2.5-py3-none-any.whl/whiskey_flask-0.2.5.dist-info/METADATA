# :tumbler_glass:  Whiskey makes writing happen.

 Whiskey is a static site generator focusing on making writing happen. It gets
 out of the way so you can focus on telling your story.

## Features

* Built around flat Markdown files using the power of Pandoc
* Built-in publish and backup functionalities
* Command-line driven
* Has an "update" post-style for tweet-like posts
* Generates feeds of regular posts, update posts, and all posts so you
  can integrate updates with sites like [micro.blog](https://micro.blog)

## Install

To install Whiskey, run:

```sh
python3 -m pip install whiskey-flask
```
