Description: # ColorizeXL
        Python implementation of the following [paper](https://www.cse.huji.ac.il/~yweiss/Colorization/) by Anat Levin, Dani Lischinski, Yair Weiss, puublished in SIGGRAPH04.
        
        We have adapted their technique to make it suitable for large images, by using overlapping patches with annotations.
        
        
        ## Installation:
        
        `pip install colorizexl`
        
        
        # Usage
        
        ## Colorization of Black & White images
        Previous to using the package, you have to setup the following:
        * original black & white image
        * annotation color image (please check details in the paper)
        
        
        ## Recolorization of color images
        Previous to using the package, you have to setup the following:
        * original color image
        * annotation image (please check details in the paper): white where the color stays the same, different colo where yo want to recolorize
        
        ## Command line
        Call the `colorizexl.py` from command line, to colorize or recolorize images.
        
        `python colorizexl.py --annotated=<path_to_annotated_image>
                              --grayscale=<path_to_image_to_(re)colorize> 
                              --output=<path_to_(re)colorized_image>
                              --recolorize=True/False`
        
        ## Python code
        ```
        from colorizexl import ColorizeXL
        
        colorizer = ColorizeXL(
                input_grayscale_name, input_annotation_name, recolorize=False
            )
        
        output = colorizer.colorize(step_size=patch_size, overlap=overlap, n=neighbour)
        ```
