X = CS
where
X(nxk): Spectroscopic data where n spectra acquired over k energy levels
C(nxa): Composition map based on a MCRLLM components
S(axk): Spectra of the a components as computed by MCRLLM

# Hierarchical MCRLLM (3 steps)
# 
# MCR takes an input X spectral matrix to obtain:
# C : composition map or n components
# S : spectra of the n components
#
# STEP 1. 
# Call raw X data and repeatedly it subdivided it into n=2
# components. This generates multiple spectra (S=2 for each)
# subdivision.
#
# STEP 2.
# PCA on the multiple spectra to manually identify the
# reference spectra (i.e. pure species)
#
# STEP 3.
# Use the reference spectra (step 2) to compute C. This is either
# done using:
# - (half_MCR): MCRLLM in which the spectra S are not evaluted anew.
# - (full_MCR): MCRLLM in which the spectra S are evaluated anew.
#               spectra from step 2 are used as a starting point.
