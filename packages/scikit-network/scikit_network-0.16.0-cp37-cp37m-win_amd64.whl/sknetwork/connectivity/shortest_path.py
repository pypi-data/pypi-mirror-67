    Parameters
    ----------
    adjacency:
        The adjacency matrix of the graph
    method:
        The method to be used. Must be ``'auto'`` (default), ``'FW'`` (Floyd-Warshall), ``'D'`` (Dijkstra),
        ``'BF'`` (Bellman-Ford) or ``'J'`` (Johnson).
    directed:
        Denotes if the graph is directed
    return_predecessors:
        If ``True``, the size predecessor matrix is returned
    unweighted:
        If ``True``, the weights of the edges are ignored
    overwrite:
        If ``True`` and ``method == 'FW'``, overwrites the given adjacency
    indices:
        If specified, only compute the paths for the points at the given indices. Will not work with ``method =='FW'``.
    n_jobs:
        If an integer value is given, denotes the number of workers to use (-1 means the maximum number will be used).
        If ``None``, no parallel computations are made.

    Returns
    -------
    dist_matrix: np.ndarray
        The matrix of distances between graph nodes. ``dist_matrix[i,j]`` gives the shortest
        distance from point ``i`` to point ``j`` along the graph.
    predecessors: np.ndarray, optional
        Returned only if ``return_predecessors == True``. The matrix of predecessors, which can be used to reconstruct
        the shortest paths. Row i of the predecessor matrix contains information on the shortest paths from point ``i``:
        each entry ``predecessors[i, j]`` gives the index of the previous node in the path from point ``i`` to point
        ``j``. If no path exists between point ``i`` and ``j``, then ``predecessors[i, j] = -9999``.
