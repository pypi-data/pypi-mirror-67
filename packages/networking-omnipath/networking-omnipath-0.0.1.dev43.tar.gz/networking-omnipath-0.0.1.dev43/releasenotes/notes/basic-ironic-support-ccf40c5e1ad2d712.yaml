features:
  - |
    Ironic baremetal provisioning with Intel Omni-Path Architecture virtual
    fabrics (networks) attached is now supported.
issues:
  - |
    Directly provisioning the baremetal nodes over the OPA interface is not
    a capability of this release. Nodes still have to be PXE-booted over an
    Ethernet interface.
upgrade:
  - |
    To upgrade, simply update this package and restart neutron-server.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixed calling of OPA Fabric Manager with certain incorrect operations.
  - |
    Fixed devstack injection of configuration options to have the right order
    of mechanism drivers.
  - |
    Other fixes and improvements
other:
  - |
    This release no longer needs an Ironic out-of-tree change for client-id,
    instead using option 61 of extra_dhcp_opts to pass the portguid from
    Ironic to Neutron and then to the Fabric Manager.
