Description: # Tracker
        Tracker is a python package, that can be integrated into any django project as middleware. It asynchronously 
        intercepts requests and sends metric data to our backend
        
        ### Editing settings
        To make Tracker work properly, settings.py file should be modified
        
        - Add the following line to the MIDDLEWARE (after all django middlewares:
        ```python
        'rigidanalytics.middleware.Analytics',
        ```
        - Add the following dict that configures Tracker
        ```python
        RIGID_ANALYTICS = {
            'PROJECT_ID': '<id of your project>',
            'PROJECT_TOKEN': '<your project token>',
            'DEBUG_DISABLE_ANALYTICS': '<bool>',
            'BACKEND_ENDPOINT': '<custom endpoint, do not specify to use default>',
        }
        ```
