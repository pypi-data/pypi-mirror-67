# Supported Functions

### get_bundle(self) -> Dict[str, Any]
- Returns a Bundle - A collection of arbitrary STIX v2.0 Objects  
```
{
'id': 'bundle--bcbb94ea-2d3a-43f1-8c1a-62002594d2ba',
'objects': [{<STIX Domain Object, STIX Relationship Object, Marking Definition>}],
'spec_version': '2.0', 
'type': 'bundle'
}
```

### get_indicator(self)
- Returns a generator of STIX v2.0 items, while auto committing items that are read

### commit_indicators(self)
- Commit on bundle. 
- Ack server and notify indicators were received.
- As long as the server doesn't receive an Ack, the same items on each get_bundle() function call will be retrieved.

from sixgill.sixgill_feed_client import SixgillFeedClient
from sixgill.sixgill_constants import FeedStream

CLIENT_ID = "<Replace with your client id>"
CLIENT_SECRET = "<Replace with your client secret>"
CHANNEL_ID = "<Replace with channel id>"

sixgill_darkfeed_client = SixgillFeedClient(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, CHANNEL_ID, FeedStream.DARKFEED)

for indicator in sixgill_darkfeed_client.get_indicator():
    print(indicator)
    
```
