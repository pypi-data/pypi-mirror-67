Description: motifcluster
        ============
        
        A Python package for motif-based spectral clustering of weighted directed networks.
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        The **motifcluster** package provides
        implementations of motif-based spectral clustering
        of weighted directed networks in Python.
        These provide the capability for:
        
        - Building motif adjacency matrices
        - Sampling random weighted directed networks
        - Spectral embedding with motif adjacency matrices
        - Motif-based spectral clustering
        
        The methods are all designed to run quickly on large sparse networks,
        and are easy to install and use.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        .. code-block:: bash
        
          pip install motifcluster
        
        Dependencies
