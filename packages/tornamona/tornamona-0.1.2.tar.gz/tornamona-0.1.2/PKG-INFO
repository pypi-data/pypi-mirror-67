        A series of fixes for Data originating from Northern Ireland
        
        This is very much a work in progress and I'll only really add to it as things annoy me,
        but if you have a data set that's messy, and you can use similar workflows as demonstrated
        in this repo, please feel free to use this and PR the crap out of it.
        
        I make no claims of liability, credit, or property over any of this, and make no promises
        that anything will ever work or be fixed.
        
        ## Current Datasets
        
        ### NISRA Weekly Deaths Datasets
        
        Source: https://www.nisra.gov.uk/publications/weekly-deaths
        
        #### What is this data?
        * Weekly death registrations in Northern Ireland, from 2009 - 2020
        * Also includes tracking of 2020 COVID outbreak
        
        #### What is wrong with the data as presented?
        * The Usual Boilerplate (i.e. non numerical footers, non-merged multi row headers, overly complex column headers, inconsistent structure)
        * ~~a typo in the 2014 Week Start date ([Which actually inspired me to make this repo in the first place](https://twitter.com/Bolster/status/1254017115817943041))~~ ([This was fixed](https://twitter.com/NISRA/status/1254689659311054848))
        
        #### How do I use the new one
        
        ```python
        from tornamona.fixes import nisra
        
        dataset = nisra.WeeklyDeaths().get().clean()
        dataset.data.head().to_markdown()
        ```
        |    |   Week | Week Start          | Week End            |   Total Deaths |   Average Deaths for previous 5 years |   Min 5 year deaths |   Max 5 year deaths |   Respiratory Deaths |   Average Respiratory Deaths for previous 5 years |   COVID19 Deaths |
