Overview of nextstep
======================

Nextstep integrates major popular machine learning algorithms, 
offering data scientists an all-in-one package. 
At the same time, it lifts the programming constraints 
by extracting key hyper-parameters into a configuration dictionary, 
empowering less experienced python users the ability to explore machine learning. 

Nextstep was originally developed for a data science challenge which involved price prediction. 
So it has a dedicated module to obtain data (oil and weather) via open API or web-scraping. 
It evolves into a machine learning prediction toolkit.
