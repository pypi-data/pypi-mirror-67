How can I send a SMS to someone else?
-------------------------------------

You cannot. I did not bother implementing this because my cell phone provider provides an API to send free SMS to myself. Then, on my smarthone, I copy-paste SMS to its recipient.

Can I send images as MMS?
-------------------------

No. My phone provider provides a free API to send SMS, but not MMS, so I did not bother implementing it.

`Patches <https://framagit.org/spalax/paste2sms/issues>`_ are welcome to fix this.

Does it work on Windows or MacOS?
---------------------------------

No. But most of ``paste2sms`` is portable (the main part that is not is the notification system):
