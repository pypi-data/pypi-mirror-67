# jspline

Multi-dimensional parameterized spline curves (snappiness parameter gives uniform cubic B-splines, four-point subdivision splines, uniform quintic B-splines, and everything in-between)

# Description

J-Splines are awesome: they're a class of spline curves that take a shape parameter, s. Setting s=1 yields uniform cubic B-spline curves, s=0 gives four-point subdivision curves, s=0.5 are uniform quintic B-splines - and more. "s" basically governs the "snappiness" of the curve.

`jspline`, lets you choose any combination of J-Spline parameters for any number of input arrays, with a range of different starting and ending schemes (eg: open or closed loops). Use it for 2D drawing, 3D graphics, or any other kind of interpolation you might need.
