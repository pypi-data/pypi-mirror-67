        **PyCO2SYS** is a Python implementation of CO<sub>2</sub>SYS, based on the [MATLAB v2.0.5](https://github.com/jamesorr/CO2SYS-MATLAB) but also including the updates made for tentatively forthcoming MATLAB v1.21 as well as some additional related calculations. This software calculates the full marine carbonate system from values of any two of its variables.
        
        Every combination of input parameters has been tested, with differences in the results small enough to be attributable to floating point errors and iterative solver endpoint differences (i.e. negligible). See the scripts in the [compare](compare) directory to see how and check this for yourself. **Please [let us know](https://github.com/mvdh7/PyCO2SYS/issues) ASAP if you discover a discrepancy that we have not spotted!**
        
        Documentation is under construction at [PyCO2SYS.readthedocs.io](https://pyco2sys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

        The citation for PyCO2SYS alone is:

        The DOI above refers to all versions of PyCO2SYS.  Please be sure to update the version number in the citation if necessary.  You can find the current version that you are using in Python with:
        
        ```python
        import PyCO2SYS as pyco2
        pyco2.say_hello()
        ```
        
        As per the instructions in the [the CO2SYS-MATLAB repo](https://github.com/jamesorr/CO2SYS-MATLAB), you should also cite the original work by [Lewis and Wallace (1998)](https://pyco2sys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/refs/#LW98).
        
        Additionally, for the MATLAB programs:
        
          * If you use `CO2SYS.m`, please cite [van Heuven et al. (2011)](https://pyco2sys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/refs/#HPR11).
          * If you use `errors.m` or `derivnum.m`, please cite [Orr et al. (2018)](https://pyco2sys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/refs/#OEDG18).
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install from the Python Package Index:
        
            pip install PyCO2SYS
        
        Update an existing installation:
        
            pip install PyCO2SYS --upgrade --no-cache-dir
        
        ## Basic use
        
        The default API has been kept as close to the MATLAB version as possible, although the first output is now a dict for convenience.  If you want the MATLAB-like experience, recommended usage is therefore:
        
        ```python
        from PyCO2SYS import CO2SYS
        CO2dict = CO2SYS(PAR1, PAR2, PAR1TYPE, PAR2TYPE, SAL, TEMPIN, TEMPOUT, PRESIN, PRESOUT,
            SI, PO4, pHSCALEIN, K1K2CONSTANTS, KSO4CONSTANTS, NH3=0.0, H2S=0.0, KFCONSTANT=1,
            buffers_mode='auto')
        ```
        
        Each field in the output `CO2dict` corresponds to a column in the original MATLAB output `DATA`.  The keys to the dict come from the original MATLAB output `HEADERS`.  Vector inputs should be provided as Numpy arrays.  Everything gets flattened with `ravel`.  Single-value inputs are fine - they are automatically cast into correctly-sized arrays.  The extra inputs not present in the MATLAB version are all optional and explained [in the documentation](https://pyco2sys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/co2sys/#inputs).
        
        It is also possible to provide Pandas Series and Xarray DataArrays using the wrapper functions provided.  For this and a more detailed explanation of all the inputs and outputs, see the [documentation](https://pyco2sys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/co2sys/).
        
        You can also look at the [example scripts](examples) here in the repo, or there are also some [examples as Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/mvdh7/PyCO2SYS-examples) that you can try out without needing to install anything on your computer.
