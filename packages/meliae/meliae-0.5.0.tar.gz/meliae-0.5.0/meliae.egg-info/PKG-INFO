Description: This project is similar to heapy (in the 'guppy' project), in its attempt to
        understand how memory has been allocated.
        
        Currently, its main difference is that it splits the task of computing summary
        statistics, etc of memory consumption from the actual scanning of memory
        consumption. It does this, because I often want to figure out what is going on
        in my process, while my process is consuming huge amounts of memory (1GB, etc).
        It also allows dramatically simplifying the scanner, as I don't allocate python
        objects while trying to analyze python object memory consumption.
        
        It will likely grow to include a GUI for browsing the reference graph. For now
        it is mostly used in the python interpreter.
        
        The name is simply a fun word (means Ash-wood Nymph).
