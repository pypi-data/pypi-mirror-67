evoalgos has been tested with Python 2.7 and 3.6. The recommended version is
Python 3.x, because compatibility is reached by avoiding usage of xrange. So,
the code has a higher memory consumption under Python 2.

Everything in this package is pure Python. For a description of the contents
see DESCRIPTION.rst.


Changes
=======

1.1
---
* Gave NearestBetterClustering an attribute `require_incoming_edge` that can
  be used to tighten selection rule 1. If set to true, individuals need an
  incoming edge in the nearest better graph as an additional requirement to
  be selected. This shall now be called rule 1b.
* Fixed bugs for corner cases in HyperVolumeIndicator.calc_contributions_2d.
  On the same note, HyperVolumeContributionSorting.sort_front now asserts
  that `prefer_boundary_points` is false and the SMSEMOA constructor checks
  if arguments `prefer_boundary_points` and `offsets` do not contradict.
* Made it possible to process problems with tuples as objective values in
  CMSAES.minimize. In this case the length of the tuple must be supplied in
  the argument `num_objectives`.
* Fixed several bugs pertaining to the processing of keyword arguments and
  the options dict in CMSAES.minimize.

1.0
---
* Corrected documentation for NearestBetterSorting.
* Added two functions calc_contributions and calc_contributions_2d in
  HyperVolumeIndicator to be able to assess exclusive hypervolume contributions
  directly there.
* Simplified HyperVolumeContributionSorting by using the functionality now
  available in HyperVolumeIndicator.
* Implemented greedy forward selection in HyperVolumeContributionSelection.
* Made the `already_chosen` argument functional in
  HyperVolumeContributionSelection and TruncationSelection.
* Added an archive as an attribute to EvolutionaryAlgorithm, which is then
  passed as the already_chosen argument to selection.

0.9
---
* Added a random permutation of the population before the survivor selection,
  to break ties randomly (in the following stable sorting).
* Replaced SBXIndividual with ESIndividual in the SMS-EMOA example in the
  documentation.
* Adapted the parallelization example in the documentation to the interface
  changes in optproblems 1.1.
* Added a convenience class CMSAES with a function minimize that mimics the
  SciPy interface to all optimization algorithms.
* Changed order of arguments num_offspring and max_age in EA constructors.

0.8
---
* Added performance measures PeakRatio, PeakDistance, PeakInaccuracy, and
  AveragedHausdorffDistance for multi-local optimization.
* Applied the template function design pattern to recombination just as in
  mutation. Now, method _recombine must be overridden in individuals.
* Implemented CMSAIndividual with covariance matrix self-adaptation. This
  induces a dependency on NumPy.
* Made it possible to call individual.recombine with num_parents == 1 in
  ESReproduction. This is also supported by a few individuals.

0.7
---
* Added FixedSizeSetIndividual to evoalgos.individual. It can be used to evolve
  sets of fixed size and bitstrings with a fixed number of ones.
* evoalgos.reproduction.ESReproduction got a new argument
  "redetermine_first_parent".
* Added a function connected_components to
  evoalgos.niching.NearestBetterClustering.
* Added forgotten documentation for RankSumSorting.

0.6
---
* Gave distance function argument a default for NearestBetterSorting and
  NearestBetterSelection.
* Changed the provided distance for NearestBetterSorting and
  NearestBetterSelection from squared Euclidean distance to Euclidean distance.
* Added a module evoalgos.niching with the two basin identification methods
  TopographicalSelection and NearestBetterClustering.
* Moved the inner class NearestBetterSorting.DistMatrixFunction to its own
  module. New place: evoalgos.distance.DistMatrixFunction.

0.5
---
* Simplified the code in the sorting module.
* Added sorting component RankSumSorting for many-objective optimization.
* Added a multiobjective mode of operation to NearestBetterSorting and
  NearestBetterSelection.

0.4
---
* LexicographicSorting can now also sort when objective values are just scalars.
* Implemented NearestBetterSorting and NearestBetterSelection.
* identify_groups() and identify_best_group() of CrowdingDistanceSorting and
  HyperVolumeContributionSorting now also consider the respective secondary
  criteria (before: only dominance relation).
* Added documentation about parallelization.

0.3
---
* Added BinaryIndividual for optimization in binary search spaces.
* Added convenience classes CommaEA and PlusEA, which are special cases of
  EvolutionaryAlgorithm. By default, they are intended for single-objective
  optimization.

0.2
---
* Implemented the NSGA2b (NSGA2 with extensions).
* Fixed bug when individuals with identical objective values should be sorted
  by HyperVolumeContributionSorting (led to "unorderable types" exception
  under Python 3).
* Changed default setting for parameter "prefer_boundary_points" of SMSEMOA
  to True.

0.1
---
* Initial version containing the SMS-EMOA.
