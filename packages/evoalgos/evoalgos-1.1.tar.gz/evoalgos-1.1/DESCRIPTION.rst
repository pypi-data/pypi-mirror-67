Description
===========

This package contains the S-metric selection evolutionary multi-objective
optimization algorithm (SMS-EMOA) and the non-dominated sorting genetic
algorithm 2 (NSGA2) for multiobjective optimization. For single-objective
optimization, classical evolution strategies and the rather unknown CMSA-ES
(covariance matrix self-adaptation evolution strategy) are provided.
Variation for real-valued and binary search spaces is included and new
variation operators can be easily added thanks to the modular concept.

The package is geared to work with optimization problems as defined in the
package optproblems. The whole package assumes minimization problems
throughout!
