Description: This is intended as decorator version of the built-in `timeit` Python module.
        
        Extras include sending emails when time thresholds are exceeded and capability of using your own `logger.Logger()` instance to log messages.
        
        Built with Django in mind, but can be used with Python in general.
        
        Usage:
        
        ```python
        from timeit_plus import tplus
        
        @tplus()
        def foo(bar):
            return bar
        ```
        
        Optional keyword arguments you can pass to the `tplus()` decorator:
        
        - `max_time`: TBC
        - `email_config`: TBC
        - `logger`: TBC
        
        This README is still wip, check out decorator docstring for more info.
