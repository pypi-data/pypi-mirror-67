Description: # godirect
        
        A Python module for reading from [Vernier Go DirectÂ® Sensors](https://www.vernier.com/products/sensors/go-direct-sensors/) using USB or BLE.
        
        Take a look at the [godirect-examples repository](https://github.com/VernierST/godirect-examples) for ideas and a number of helpful examples.
        
        ## Requirements
        
        The following Python modules are required for `godirect`. They will be installed
        automatically as dependencies when installing `godirect` via pip.
        
        * pexpect
        
        The following Python modules are recommended for `godirect`. They will only be installed if they are specified as `extras` when installing `godirect` via pip. See below.
        
        * vernierpygatt (fork of the pygatt project with a fix for the BGAPI on Windows)
        * hidapi (USB HID device support)
        
        ## Installation
        
        Automatically install the `extras` support dependencies for both USB and BLE.
        ```bash
        pip install godirect[usb,ble]
        ```
        
        In order to use the native Windows 10 or Linux BLE stack, Bleak must be installed.  To install:
        ```bash
        pip install bleak
        ```
        
        ## Installation and Usage
        
        Go to our [Getting Started with Vernier Go Direct Sensors and Python document](https://github.com/VernierST/godirect-examples/blob/master/python/readme.md) for detailed information regarding installation and usage of the godirect module.
