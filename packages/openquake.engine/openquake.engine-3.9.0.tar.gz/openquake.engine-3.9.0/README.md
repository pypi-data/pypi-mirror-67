# OpenQuake Engine

![OpenQuake Logo](https://github.com/gem/oq-infrastructure/raw/master/logos/oq-logo.png)

The **OpenQuake Engine** is an open source application that allows users to compute **seismic hazard** and **seismic risk** of earthquakes on a global scale. It runs on Linux, macOS and Windows, on laptops, workstations, standalone servers and multi-node clusters. DOI: [10.13117/openquake.engine](https://doi.org/10.13117/openquake.engine)

## OpenQuake Engine version 3.9 (Taylor)

Starting from OpenQuake version 2.0 we have introduced a "code name" to honour earthquake scientists.

The code name for version 3.9 is **Taylor**, in memory of the late Peter Taylor, Director at Oasis Loss Modelling Framework. We enjoyed robust and constructive discussions with Peter in 2015 which laid the foundations for closer collaboration between GEM and OASIS LMF. Peter made a real contribution to open loss modelling frameworks and recognised that sharing and collaboration are key to better understanding and mitigating risk.
