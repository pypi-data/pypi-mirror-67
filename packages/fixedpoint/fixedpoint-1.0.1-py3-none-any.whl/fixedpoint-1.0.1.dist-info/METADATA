The fixedpoint package offers several features that are widely used in
DSP applications:

* Generate fixed point numbers from
  string literals,
  integers, or
  floating point numbers.
* Specify bit widths and signedness, or allow it to be deduced
* Various rounding methods
* Various overflow handling methods
* Configurable alerts for
  overflow,
  property mismatches, and
  implicit casting errors
* Arithmetic operations such as
  addition,
  subtraction,
  multiplication,
  exponentiation
* Bitwise operations AND, OR, XOR, and
  inversion.
* Type casting to int, float, bool, str
* Built-in string formatting
  (f-strings or str.format)
* Comparisons with other FixedPoint, int, or
  float objects

The fixedpoint package is unit-tested against MATLAB stimulus (with the fixed
point toolbox), making the fixedpoint package a viable, accurate, and
cost-free alternative to MATLAB.

The fixedpoint package is released under the BSD license.
