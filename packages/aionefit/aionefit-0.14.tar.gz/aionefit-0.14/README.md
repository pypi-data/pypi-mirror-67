# Python asyncio library for (some) Bosch thermostats

aionefit is a Python library to control some Bosch thermostats using the Python asycio framework. This is done with the [Slixmpp](https://slixmpp.readthedocs.io) library.

As there is no known way to talk directly to the thermostat, all communication has to be routed via cloud servers at Bosch.
