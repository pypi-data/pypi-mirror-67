> PIMUX is here, made with :heart:

## What is pimux?
> pimux is a python module created by me, to access the termux-api(hardware
> and software api). To ease the access of these beautiful api's which 
> can be really useful for IOT projects deploying using your own android phone.

## Why to use pimux?
> For every pythonist and enthusiast pimux can really ease hardware and software
> access through termux-api.

## Special thanks 
 I would like to thank every developer before me who made this beautiful
 language(python),termux-api, termux, os(linux), and all others, on whose
 contributions I have been able to make this.
