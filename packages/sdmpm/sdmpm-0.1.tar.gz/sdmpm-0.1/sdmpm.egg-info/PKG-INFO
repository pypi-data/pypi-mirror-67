        SystemD supports multiple processes of the exact same type using templating. However, it's very tedious to scale the number of processes up or down. This script aims to simplify that.
        
        ## Installation
        
        The script is published on PyPI under the name `sdmpm`.
        
        1. Use a tool like [pipx](https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx) or [psm](https://github.com/anlutro/psm) to install this script into a dedicated virtualenv: `psm install sdmpm`
        2. Install using pip: `pip install sdmpm` (preferably with `--user` or in a virtualenv)
        
        You can also just download the script directly from Github, it has no external dependencies and is tested on Python 3.5 and higher.
        
        ```bash
        wget https://github.com/anlutro/systemd-multi-process-manager/raw/master/src/sdmpm.py -o /usr/local/bin/sdmpm
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Assuming you have a templated service already configured (i.e. there is an `/etc/systemd/system/example@.service`), you can use this to determine how many of this process should be running:
        
        ```
        $ sdmpm scale example 4
        ```
        
        You can also use the standard `systemctl` commands such as `status`, `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `enable` and `disable`.
        
        You can pass `--user` which will work just like `systemctl --user`.
