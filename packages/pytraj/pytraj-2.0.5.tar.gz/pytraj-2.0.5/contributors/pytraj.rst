Acknowledgement
===============

**Hai Nguyen** thanks

    * **Jason Swails** (creator of `ParmEd <https://github.com/ParmEd/ParmEd>`_) for his help (suggestion for designing API, git experience, porting code and his encouragement). http://jswails.wikidot.com/
    
    * **Daniel R. Roe** (creator of `cpptraj <https://github.com/mojyt/cpptraj>`_) for helping technical detail about C++, compiling and designing cpptraj interface.

    * **James Maier** (1st author of AMBER ff14SB force field) for his suggestion to write pytraj (rather than rewrite a new Python package to replace cpptraj) and his stimulating discussion about programming. http://jmaier.info

A part of pytraj's API is influenced by the design in [MDTraj](http://mdtraj.org/) package.
