        The repo contains a small set of tools to create visualisations I constantly find inside of ML papers. It is also primarily a personal testbed for practicing software engineering practices and the whole PyPI/RTD/Github/CI ecosystem.
        
        If you find any of the tools useful please consider leaving a star on the repo or contributing!
        
        ## Installation
        
        The most stable version can be installed from PyPI via `pip` in the terminal.
        
        ```bash
        pip install usualsuspects
        ```
        
        Alternatively the *bleeding* edge version of this little library will be on the repo. Buiding from sources is as simple as cloning the repo and running a developer install in the root folder of the directory (where `setup.py` is) with:
        
        ```bash
        pip install -e . 
        ```
        
        This will allow you to adapt the source code to your liking and the changes will take effect immediately.
        
        ## Contributing
        TODO. Will set this up after CI is set up.
