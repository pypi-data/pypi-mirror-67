        A decorator for an asyncronous state transition.
        (i,e the state transition request call will return imeditely, but the state transition will only happen in the future).
        After the state transition request call is made, the state will transition to the transitionState, and then will only transition to the
        desired state after an event has occured.
        The request will only be succseffull if the state is currently is one of the validEntryStates, and if it is not currently allready transitioning.
        Requests can be canceled using the cancel() method on the task (See example code).
        The function this is decorating must be a member function, and the owning class must have a dict to store the currenty pending tasks.
        @param taskMapName: The name of the Dict of pending tasks, belonging to the class that owns the member function that this is decorating
        @param stateToChangeName: The name of the state to change, belonging to the class that owns the member function that this is decorating
        @param validEntryStates: a list of enums of possible entry states that this trasition can be made from. If the state to change is not one of these,
            the request will fail
        @param transitionState: if the request is successufull, the state to change will imediely go into this transition state
        @param signal: an awaitable (async) function pointer that blocks the transition from happening imeditely. E.g this could be a timer if the state transition
            should happen afetr a time delay, or it could be a blocking function that waits untill an event has occured.
        @param *args: arguments for the signal. These are optional
