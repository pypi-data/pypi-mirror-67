Snow is a simple and lightweight yet powerful and extensible library for interacting with ServiceNow. It works
with modern versions of Python, utilizes [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) and 
can be used for simple scripting as well as for building high-concurrency backend applications on top of the ServiceNow platform.
