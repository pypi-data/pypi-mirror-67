It works\nwith modern versions of Python, utilizes [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) and \ncan be used for simple scripting as well as for building high-concurrency backend applications on top of the ServiceNow platform.\n\nDocumentation\n---\n\nThe Snow API reference, examples and more is available in the [documentation](https://python-snow.readthedocs.io/en/latest).\n\nDevelopment status\n---\n\nAlpha\n\nContributing\n---\n\nCheck out the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you want to help out with code or documentation.\n\n\nFunding\n-------\n\nThe Snow code is permissively licensed, and can be incorporated into any type of application–commercial or otherwise–without costs or limitations.\nIts author believes it's in the commercial best-interest for users of the project to invest in its ongoing development.\n\nConsider leaving a [donation](https://paypal.vault13.org) if you like this software, it will:\n\n- Directly contribute to faster releases, more features, and higher quality software.\n- Allow more time to be invested in documentation, issue triage, and community support.\n- Safeguard the future development of Snow.\n\nAuthor\n------\n\nRobert Wikman \\<rbw@vault13.org\\>\n\n",
