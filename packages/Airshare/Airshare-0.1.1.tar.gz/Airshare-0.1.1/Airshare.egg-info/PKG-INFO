        <p align="justify"><b>Airshare</b> is a Python-based CLI tool and module that lets you transfer data between two machines in a local network, P2P, using Multicast DNS. It also opens an HTTP gateway for other non-CLI external interfaces. It works completely offline! Built with aiohttp and zeroconf.</p>

        ```

        Send and receive files and directories.
        
        To send using the CLI,
        
        ```bash
        $ airshare noobmaster requirements.txt
        ```
        To receive using the CLI,
        
        ```bash
        $ airshare noobmaster
        ```
        
        or visit `http://noobmaster.local` in the browser to download.
        
        You can also `import airshare` in any Python program. Visit the documentation for detailed usage instructions.
        
        ## Known Issues
        
        * The QR Code feature is not available on Windows. Terminals on Windows are unable to render QR Codes despite our extensive attempts and tests - let us know if you have a solution!
        
        * Link-local Name Resolution, for example, `http://noobmaster.local`, does not work on Android phones. This is because Android browsers do not have inbuilt Multicast-DNS service discovery.
        
        * Multiple progress bars for concurrent file uploads using `tqdm` may not work as intended on some terminals, refer to the `tqdm` documentation for more details.
