Merlin-py is a tool that makes use of camelot ( /atlanhq/camelot ) and tabula ( /tabulapdf/tabula ) to furthur simplify the extraction of tabular data from PDFs. Merlin-py aims to simplify data extraction by providing a search logic to users of the package for data extraction, whether that be a table label, set of column names, or table dimensions. An ideal use case is for the extraction of a common data table across many hundreds, or thousands of separate pdfs where the desired data is in different locations on each document.. (Tax documents, historical records, etc)

Big thanks to the developers and contributors of both tabula-py and camelot-py as this project is largely built atop these two other efforts.

1 - Youtube / Video tutorial with accompanying jupyter notebooks.
