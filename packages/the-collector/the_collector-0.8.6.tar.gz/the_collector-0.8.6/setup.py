The main structure is a dict which has keys\nfor each data series stored.\n\nThis was written for a class I taught on robotics. It is meant to be simple and\nteach the students some things. There are probably better solutions out there,\nbut I like this.\n\nAdditionally, there is nothing magically about what this does:\n\n- It provides a generic interface to using `pickle` or `json` as\nthe protocol for saving data to disk\n- It also allows you to convert between them if needed\n- Bag files can be read using the original protocol, thus data is never lost\nif this library goes away\n- Designed to be simple and straight forward\n\n## Setup\n\n### Install\n\nThe suggested way to install this is via the `pip` command as follows:\n\n    pip install the_collector\n    pip install the_collector[numpy]\n\nIf you install `numpy`, then you get access to working with numpy arrays\nusing the functions: `array_pack()` and `array_pack()`. These really don\'t\nsave you much.\n\n# Usage\n\n## BagIt\n\nBag stores data in memory until the buffer size limit is reached then it dumps\nthe data to a file.\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nfrom __future__ import print_function\nfrom the_collector import BagIt\nfrom the_collector import Json, Pickle\nimport json\n\n\nd = {\'a\': 1, \'b\': 2}\n\nbag = BagIt(Json)      # ascii, cross platform\n# bag = BagIt(Pickle)  # binary, python only but handles python objects well\n\nfor i in range(10):\n    bag.push(\'test\', d) # push value d to key \'test\'\n    bag.push(\'bob\', d)\n    bag.push(\'tom\', (\'a\', i,))\n\n# timestamp adds a timestamp automatically to the bag file. Thus, you won\'t\n# over write bob.json.bag each time you run this program because the filename\n# is bob-2019-04-20-15:35:25.6543.json.bag\nfname = bag.write(\'bob\', timestamp=False)\n\nprint(">> created:", fname)\n\ndata = bag.read(fname) # data is just a dictionary\nprint(data)\n```\n\nNow, since there is nothing super special `the_collector` does with packing\ndata, you can always read the bag files using the original libraries:\n\n```python\nwith open(fname, \'rb\') as fd:\n    data = json.load(fd)\n\nfor key, val in data.items():\n    print("{}[{}]".format(key, len(val)))\n    for v in val:\n        print("{}".format(v), end=\' \')\n        print(\' \')\n```\n\n## Circular Buffer\n\nThis is perhaps a little out of place, but I use circular buffers with handling data\nso I stuck it in this library.\n\n```python\nfrom the_collector import CircularBuffer\n\ncb = CircularBuffer(60)  # can only hold 60 items before it copies over data\n\n# Let\'s push way more than 60 things\nfor i in range(200):\n    cb.push(i)\n\nprint(cb.get_all())  # print everything\nprint(\'get cb[7]\', cb[7])\nprint(\'get cb[0]\', cb[0])\nprint(\'get last\', cb.get_last())\n```\n\n## Data Tuple\n\nUse a generic `namedtuple` for data storage. It will automatically insert a\ntimestamp when created. This is useful for tagging data with a timestamp and\nnot having to remember to do it yourself.\n\n**WARNING:** `json` and `msgpack` have issues with `tuples`, so this is best\nused with `pickle` or you have to accept `json` will turn it into a list and\n`msgpack` will turn it into a regular `tuple`. Either way, you still keep the\ntimestamp.\n\n```python\nfrom the_collector import Data\n\nd = Data((1,2,3,))  # timestamp generate when made\n\nprint("Data[{}]: {}".format(d.timestamp, d.data))\nprint("Namedtuple output:", d)\n```\n\n# Todo\n\n- [x] add github actions\n- [ ] look at enabling `BytesIO` for testing/working so you don\'t litter filing system\nwith test bag files\n- [x] support PEP517 and replace `setup.py` with `pyprogram.toml`\n- [x] move tests from `nose` to `pytest`\n- [x] remove `msgpack`, there is no advantage to it over `pickle`(python only) or `json`(cross platform)\n- [x] add `json` compression back in\n\n# Change Log\n\nDate        | Version| Notes\n------------|--------|----------------------------------\n2020-04-19  | 0.8.5  | removed `msgpack`\n2019-07-06  | 0.8.2  | add generic data container\n2019-04-28  | 0.8.0  | can store data using `json`, `pickle`, or `msgpack`\n2018-07-25  | 0.7.0  | added `msgpack` messages and a way to do custom messages\n2018-07-14  | 0.6.0  | changed interface to support buffered writing to disk\n2018-07-09  | 0.5.0  | moved away from `json` and now using `msgpack`\n2017-11-23  | 0.4.0  | fixes, documentation, unit tests\n2017-10-04  | 0.0.1  | init\n\n# The MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2017 Kevin J.
