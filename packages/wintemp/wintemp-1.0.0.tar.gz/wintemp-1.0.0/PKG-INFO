Description: # Temp Remover for Windows
        
        The Temp Remover for Windows, as the name suggests, is a basic Windows Temporary File remover that removes all unwanted .tmp files from the C:/Windows/Temp directory.
        
        ## Installation
        
        You can install Temp Remover for Windows using Pip
        
            pip install wintemp==1.0.0
        
        ## How to Use
        
        Usage of the Temp Remover is very simple and staightforward. You can use the following sample code to clean you Windows Temp directory.
        
            from wintemp import wintemp
        
            clean = wintemp.temp_cleaner()
        
        The default **Temp** folder is set to **C:/Windows/Temp**
        
        You can, if you want to, use a custom directory to clean.
        
        Look at the sample code below
        
            from wintemp import wintemp
        
            clean = wintemp.temp_cleaner(folder = 'your custom folder')
        Just replace **your custom folder** with the path of the directory you want to empty.
        
        You can also get an output **.txt** file that has the information of all the files deleted.
        
        Look at the sample code below
        
            from wintemp import wintemp
        
            clean = wintemp.temp_cleaner(out_file = True)
        
        The default value for **out_file** parameter is set to **False**. Changing it **True** would create an output file with information of all the Deleted Files and also the Files with Error.
