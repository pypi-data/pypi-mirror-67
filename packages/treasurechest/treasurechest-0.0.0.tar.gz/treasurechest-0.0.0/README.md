# Python Template

This is a template repository for Python projects. I dedicate this template to the public domain using the creative commons zero license: https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode

Recommended tools:

* virtualenv: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/
* pip-tools: https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools

This includes a setup for running tests including travis-ci. The Makefile contains a test command which will execute all test scripts in tests/ and exit with an error code if any of the tests fail.
