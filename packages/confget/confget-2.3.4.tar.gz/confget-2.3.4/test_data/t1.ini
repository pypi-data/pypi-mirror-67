# This is just a sample config file
# It is hereby placed into the public domain.

	# A sample INI file

# An INI file is separated into sections.
# Each section starts with its name in square brackets on a line by itself.
# Each section contains key=value pairs, with the whitespace before
# the key, around the equal sign, or at the end of the line simply ignored.
# A value may span multiple lines - a line continuation is denoted by
# a backslash (\) as the last character on the line.

; Empty lines, lines consisting entirely of whitespace, or lines with
; optional whitespace at the start, followed by a semicolon (;) or
; a pound sign (#) and any other characters, are ignored.

[a]
# This is section a.
key1=value1
	key2 = value2   
key3		=\
		 val'ue3

[ b sect  ]
key4=		v'alu'e4

	[   c  	   ]

	key5		= \
	\
	# value5
	# And nothing more.

# Okay, let's see what happens now...
# A section may be split within the file - another section header with
# the same name continues the definition of variables in the same section.

[a]
key6=value6

[b sect]
key7=value7

# And that's all, folks!
