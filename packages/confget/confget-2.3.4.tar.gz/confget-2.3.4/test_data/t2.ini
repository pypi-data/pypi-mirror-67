# Just a test file.  Or something.
# This file is hereby placed into the public domain.

# Some configuration files are so simple, they do not even need sections.
# The confget utility uses the concept of a "default" section - the one
# that is used if the -s option is not specified.
# If any key/value pairs is found in the INI file before the first section
# header, they - and only they - are in the default section.
# If there are no key/value pairs before the section header, then the first
# section defined is considered to be the default.

# In this file, the following two pairs will be in the default section,
# and they may be obtained by "confget -f t2.ini key1 key2".
key1=1
key2=2

# In the t1.ini file, there are no key/value pairs before the first
# section header, so the first section - "a" - will be the default,
# and "confget -f t1.ini key1" would return "value1".

# The following values of key1 and key2 may only be obtained by specifying
# the section name: "confget -f t2.ini -s sec1 key1 key2".

key1=3
