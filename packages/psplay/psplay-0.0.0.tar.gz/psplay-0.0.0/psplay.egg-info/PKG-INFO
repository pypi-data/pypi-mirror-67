Description: ======
        psplay
        ======
        
        A tool to visualize and play with CMB maps. ``psplay`` is a ``jupyter`` extension to allow
        interactive visualization of CMB maps through `Leaflet <leafletjs.com>`_ library. ``psplay`` also
        provides a set of tools based on `pspy <https://github.com/simonsobs/pspy>`_ to compute and to show
        CMB power spectra.

        All the specific javascript library developed for ``psplay`` is done by `Sigurd Naess
        <https://github.com/amaurea>`_. The build and javscript architecture is highly inspired by
        `ipyleaflet <https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipyleaflet>`_ project.
        
        To convert CMB map from ``FITS`` format to tile images you will also need this kind of `program
        <https://github.com/thibautlouis/sigurds_plot>`_.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Using pip:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
           $ pip install psplay [--user]
        
        To enable the extension within Jupyter, you will need to install several JupyterLab extensions
        especially the Python ``plotly`` `library <https://plotly.com/python>`_. For JupyterLab > 2.0.0, you
        can do
        
        .. code:: shell
        
           $ jupyter labextension install @plotlywidget@4.6.0 jupyterlab-plotly@4.6.0
        
        
        Finally, you need to install the `jupyter-leaflet-car
        <https://www.npmjs.com/package/jupyter-leaflet-car>`_ and the support for widgets in Jupyter
        
        .. code:: shell
        
           $ jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager jupyter-leaflet-car
        
        
        Installation from sources
        -------------------------
        
        For a development installation (requires `npm <https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm>`_)
        
        .. code:: shell
        
           $ git clone https://github.com/xgarrido/psplay.git
           $ cd psplay
           $ pip install -e .
        
        If you are using the classic Jupyter Notebook you need to install the nbextension:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
           $ jupyter nbextension install --py --symlink --sys-prefix psplay
           $ jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix psplay
        
        If you are using JupyterLab, you need to install the labextension:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
           $ jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager js
        
        Note for developers:
        
        - the ``-e`` pip option allows one to modify the Python code in-place. Restart the kernel in order
          to see the changes.
        - the ``--symlink`` argument on Linux or OS X allows one to modify the JavaScript code
          in-place. This feature is not available with Windows.
        
        For automatically building the JavaScript code every time there is a change, run the following
        command from the ``psplay/js/`` directory:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
           $ npm run watch
        
        
        If you are on JupyterLab you also need to run the following in a separate terminal:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
           $ jupyter lab --watch
        
        
        Every time a JavaScript build has terminated you need to refresh the Notebook page in order to load
        the JavaScript code again.
