Description: # mdb
        
        A client to [my database](https://db.marcusweinberger.repl.co)
        
        ## Installation
            pip install marcusdb
        
        Sorry, `mdb` was taken
        
        ## Usage
            import mdb
        
            keys = mdb.generate()
            # {"priv":"XXXXXXXX", "pub":"XXXXXXXXX"}
            # tip: the public key is just a hashed version of the private key [sha256(sha256(key) + salt)]
            # protip: you can choose your own key using mdb.register("YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"), but remember - if your token isn't secure, someone could crack the hash
        
            privclient = mdb.Client(keys['priv'])
            pubclient = mdb.Client(keys['pub'])
            # yep, both use the same class. attempting priv methods with pub keys just dont work
        
            privclient.store("hello", "world")
            # can store all types of data by using the jsonpickle library
        
            pubclient.retrieve("hello")
            # > "world"
        
            pubclient.store("test", "wa")
            # will return False
        
            privclient.delete("hello")
            # returns True
        
            privclient.unregister(conf=True)
            # conf defaults to false, when false will do nothing
            # deletes your account from the DB, making both keys invalid and out of the system
