# CDIR

This project exists because I felt that typing multiple `cd`, `dir`/`ls` commands and striking the tab-key is not very fast or pleasant way to navigate in shell. As developers often need to work in multiple environments, cdir supports bash shell, Windows Command Prompt and PowerShell. The core component of the project is implemented with python and uses curses module. Windows version uses [windows-curses](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/windows-curses) module.
