Description: 
                         PhyloPhlAn is an integrated pipeline for large-scale phylogenetic profiling of genomes and metagenomes.
                         PhyloPhlAn is an accurate, rapid, and easy-to-use method for large-scale microbial genome characterization and phylogenetic analysis at multiple levels of resolution.
                         PhyloPhlAn can assign both genomes and metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to species-level genome bins (SGBs).
                         PhyloPhlAn can reconstruct strain-level phylogenies using clade-specific maximally informative phylogenetic markers, and can also scale to very-large phylogenies comprising >17,000 microbial species.
