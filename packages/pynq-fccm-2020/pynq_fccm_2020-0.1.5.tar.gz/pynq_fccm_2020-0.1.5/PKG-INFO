Description: This package contains the notebooks for the PYNQ portion of the Xilinx FCCM 2020 tutorial. This getting started guide assumes you have already cloned the aws-fpga git repository and sourced the `vitis_runtime_setup.sh` script in your terminal as part of a previous lab.
        
        
        We recommend using PYNQ and Jupyterlab in an Anaconda environment open a terminal and run the following commands
        
        ```
        wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.02-Linux-x86_64.sh
        bash Anaconda3-2020.02-Linux-x86_64.sh -b
        source ~/anaconda3/bin/activate
        ```
        
        With Anaconda on initialized PYNQ and the lab material can be installed using `pip` and the PYNQ `get-notebooks` command.
        
        ```
        pip install pynq
        pip install pynq-fccm-2020
        pynq get-notebooks
        cd pynq-notebooks
        ```
        
        Finally change into the newly created directory and launch JupyterLab
        
        ```
        jupyter lab
        ```
        
        This will bring up a Jupyter Lab environment you can use to complete the lab.
        
        ## Companion Videos
        
        The labs can only show so much of PYNQ so we've created three short companion videos that cover topics that aren't addressed here. We recommending watching them in order, one after each notebook.
