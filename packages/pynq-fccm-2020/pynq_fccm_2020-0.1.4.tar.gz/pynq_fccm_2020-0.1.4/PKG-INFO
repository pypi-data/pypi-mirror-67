Description: This package contains the notebooks for the PYNQ portion of the Xilinx FCCM 2020 tutorial. This getting started guide assumes you have already cloned the aws-fpga git repository and sourced the `vitis_runtime_setup.sh` script in your terminal as part of a previous lab.
        
        
        We recommend using PYNQ and Jupyterlab in an Anaconda environment open a terminal and run the following commands
        
        ```
        wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.02-Linux-x86_64.sh
        bash Anaconda3-2020.02-Linux-x86_64.sh -b
        source ~/anaconda3/bin/activate
        ```
        
        With Anaconda on initialized PYNQ and the lab material can be installed using `pip` and the PYNQ `get-notebooks` command.
        
        ```
        pip install pynq
        pip install pynq-fccm-2020
        pynq get-notebooks
        cd pynq-notebooks
        ```
        
        Finally change into the newly created directory and launch JupyterLab
        
        ```
        jupyter lab
        ```
        
        This will bring up a Jupyter Lab environment you can use to complete the lab.
