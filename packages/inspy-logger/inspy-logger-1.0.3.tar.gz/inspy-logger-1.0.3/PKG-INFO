Description: # InSPy Logger
        
        ## Description
        
        InSPy Logger is a library package made for Python3, and is installable in any environment that has 
        access to PIP for Python3 and an internet connection.
        
        ***InSPy Logger** *could work on Python2, but it hasn't been tested as of this writing*
