# Neural Networks for Microcontrollers: Python

This is a python implementation of Neural Networks for Microcontrollers (nn4mc) (originally implemented in C++) that allows for the translation of trained neural network models to C code for use in embedded systems.

## Development Status

Please note that nn4mc_py is still in development and may have many bugs. We are working hard on getting everything operating seamlessly, and feel free to reach out with any questions.

## Using nn4mc

### Installation

Simply use the Python package manager pip and run the following command.
```
pip install nn4mc
```

### Usage

You will most likely only need to import the translator module
```python
import nn4mc.translator as nnTr
```

Then you can translate a file with the following command
```python
nnTr.translate("path/to/file", 'hdf5', "output/path")
```
