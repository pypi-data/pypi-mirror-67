Summary: Neural Networks for Microcontrollers (nn4mc) is a Python package for generating microcontroller code in c from pre-trained models. Our intended audience is roboticists looking to embed intelligence into their applications; however, anyone interested in using a neural network in a microcontroller will find this software useful.

Description: # Neural Networks for Microcontrollers: Python
        
        This is a python implementation of Neural Networks for Microcontrollers (nn4mc) (originally implemented in C++) that allows for the translation of trained neural network models to C code for use in embedded systems.
        
        ## Development Status
        
        Please note that nn4mc_py is still in development and may have many bugs. We are working hard on getting everything operating seamlessly, and feel free to reach out with any questions.
        
        ## Using nn4mc
        
        ### Installation
        
        Simply use the Python package manager pip and run the following command.
        ```
        pip install nn4mc
        ```
        
        ### Usage
        
        You will most likely only need to import the translator module
        ```python
        import nn4mc.translator as nnTr
        ```
        
        Then you can translate a file with the following command
        ```python
        nnTr.translate("path/to/file", 'hdf5', "output/path")
        ```
