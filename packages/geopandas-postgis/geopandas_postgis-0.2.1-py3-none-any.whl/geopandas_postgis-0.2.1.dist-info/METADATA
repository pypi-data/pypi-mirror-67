# GeoPandas-Postgis

Utilities oriented to using PostGIS features.

## Install

```python
pip install geopandas-postgis
```

## Requirements

* GeoPandas
* GeoAlchemy2
* SQLAlchemy
* psycopg2

## Usage

Currently, the ```postgis``` accessor only features a ```to_postgis``` method.

```python
import geopandas as gpd
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

from geopandas_postgis import PostGIS

engine = create_engine("postgresql+psycopg2://postgres:postgres/localhost:test")
my_gdf = geopandas.read_file("my_shp.shp")
my_gdf.postgis.to_postgis(con=engine, table_name='test', geometry='Polygon')
```

The ```to_postgis``` method will accept any keyword argument in the to_sql method in ```pandas```

## Testing

Postgres needs to be running on your local machine with a postgres user (that has write access.)  This will be moved to Docker over time.
