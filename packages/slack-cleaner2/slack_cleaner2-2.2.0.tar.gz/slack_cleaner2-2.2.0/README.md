```python
from slack_cleaner2 import *

s = SlackCleaner('SECRET TOKEN')
# list of users
s.users
# list of all kind of channels
s.conversations

# delete all messages in -bots channels
for msg in s.msgs(filter(match('.*-bots'), s.conversations)):
  # delete messages, its files, and all its replies (thread)
  msg.delete(replies=True, files=True)

# delete all general messages and also iterate over all replies
for msg in s.c.general.msgs(with_replies=True):
  msg.delete()
```


## Tokens

You will need to generate a Slack legacy *user* token to use slack-cleaner. You can generate a token [here](https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens):

[https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens](https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens). 

The token should start with **xoxp** and not like bot tokens with **xoxb**.

## Configuring app

The cleaner needs you to give Slack's API permission to let it run the
operations it needs. You grant these by registering it as an app in the
workspace you want to use it in.

You can grant these permissions to the app by:

1. going to [Your Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. select 'Create New App', fill out an App Name (eg 'Slack Cleaner') and
   select the Slack workspace you want to use it in
3. select 'OAuth & Permissions' in the sidebar
4. scroll down to Scopes and select all scopes you need
5. select 'Save changes'
6. select 'Install App to Workspace'
7. review the permissions and press 'Authorize'
8. copy the 'OAuth Access Token' shown, and use this token as the `--token`
   argument to the script
