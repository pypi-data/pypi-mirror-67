Description: # beancount_reds_ingestor
        
        Simple ingesting tools and importers for various institutions for Beancount (personal
        finance software).
        
        The importers are primarily ofx based, and the tools are built on top of `ofxparse`.
        
        Look inside the importers/ directory to see a list of institutions supported. More
        investment, credit card, and banking institutions will be added in the future.
        
        ## Installation
        `pip install ofxparse`
        
        ## Running
        1. modify my.import, add your account numbers
        2. `./import.sh <your_input_ofx>`
        3. If cusip info is missing, the importer will let you know. Add it to `fund_info.py`
        
        The code should be simple enough to understand.
        
        ## Contributions
        Test ofx files appreciated.
