OpenWorkflow Documentation
###########################

OpenWorkflow is a suite of development tools to facilitate the creation and
implementation of `Wearable Cognitive Assistants (WCA)`_. They key idea of
OpenWorkflow is to represent WCA application logic as a finite state machine
(FSM). You can read more about the fast prototyping methodology of OpenWorkflow
in `this document (Section 6.2) <https://junjuew.github.io/assets/thesis.pdf>`_.

OpenWorkflow provides the following tools.

* gabrieltool: A Python library to create and persist finite state machine based wearable cognitive assistants.
* OpenWorkflow State Machine Web Editor: A browser-based GUI to view and edit state machines.
* gabrieltool CLI (gbt): A command-line tool to launch a gabriel server given an FSM.
